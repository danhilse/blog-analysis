        "content": "Earlier this year, we set off on a joint venture with our friends at London Research to conduct a major marketing survey. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of how marketers are using digital marketing software (marketing automation, email service providers, customer relationship management systems, etc.) and to learn about their existing pain points. Specifically, we were curious how marketers in certain verticals were (or weren’t, as it were) using marketing automation software, which is why we focused heavily on marketers in the financial services, tech, and manufacturing industries.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Marketing Automation for Manufacturing]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MA-for-Manufacturing-Hero-1024x512.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Marketing Automation for Manufacturing]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MA-for-Manufacturing-Hero-1024x512.jpg\n\n\nAs it turns out, manufacturing marketers are still taking their first steps toward digital marketing maturity, as the overwhelming majority of marketing professionals in that sphere are not currently using marketing automation software — or even an email service provider (ESP). Subsequently, there’s a major opportunity for manufacturing and distribution companies to gain a significant advantage over their competition by adopting marketing automation platforms and working with their vendor to get the most out of this powerful and dynamic software.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about how manufacturing marketers are using marketing automation, as well as the largest challenge they’re facing in regards to their software. And, of course, be sure to download the full State of Marketing Automation report for even more useful insights.\n\n\nH2: How Is the Manufacturing Industry Utilizing Marketing Automation Software?\n\nAccording to our research, the manufacturing industry appears to be far behind the technology industry vertical and on par with their counterparts in financial services as far as digital marketing software adoption. For instance, manufacturing companies are slightly more likely to use marketing automation software than financial services companies but far less likely than the tech industry to do so. The survey results also suggest that this reluctance among manufacturers to adopt marketing automation is likely to continue — with only 19% of manufacturers saying they plan to invest in marketing software this year (compared to 48% of financial services businesses).\n\nFurther, while many marketers in the tech industry are using marketing automation software exclusively (that is, without supplementing their platforms with an ESP), only 21% of manufacturing marketers can say the same. In fact, 26% of manufacturing companies continue to use both marketing automation and an ESP, which, while that figure is less than those in other industries surveyed, still speaks to the fact that many marketers continue to invest in redundant technologies or are simply not getting everything they need from their current systems. It also implies a fundamental misunderstanding of the power and capabilities of marketing automation, despite their significant investment in the software.\n\n\nH2: Why Manufacturers Need Marketing Automation Software to Improve Their Marketing Efforts\n\nSo, while the numbers for marketers in the manufacturing sector aren’t quite where we would expect them to be at this point, the immensely bright silver lining is that now is the perfect time to capitalize on a rare opportunity to differentiate your company from your competitors. Implementing marketing automation software and learning how to use it to its full potential can make your marketing and sales just as streamlined as your production processes\n\n\nH2: The State of Marketing Automation\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of factors leading to the inevitable evolution beyond the traditional batch-and-blast email approach offered by ESPs — including GDPR and other compliance regulations, the need to scale marketing efforts more purposefully, and meeting consumer expectations for more personalized content. Further, marketers are now expected to hand sales-ready leads to their sales teams, which means an increased focus on aligning marketing software with marketing strategy, especially as it pertains to segmentation, lead scoring and nurturing, and website personalization.\n\nThankfully, now is the time to strike, as many manufacturing and distribution companies have seen amazing success since implementing the Act-On platform for their business. For instance, Allegis — a leading international supplier of latches, handles, hinges, and related products — credits Act-On with helping them conserve resources, eliminate spam complaints, and increase their email open rate by 15-20%. Additionally, Absolute Exhibits — a full-service, turnkey exhibit house that designs and creates custom tradeshow exhibits — has experienced an 85% increase in revenue since utilizing the Act-On platform. In fact, they’ve been so successful, they’re actually hiring more personnel to keep up with demand.\n\nIf your company is looking to achieve these kinds of results, we’d like to speak with you further about how Act-On makes marketing personal.\n\n\nH2: The Major Marketing Challenge Facing Manufacturing Marketers\n\nAlthough not many manufacturing and distribution marketers are using marketing automation software as of yet, those who do find themselves in the unenviable position of not being able to measure their return on investment, which is one of the great unrealized promises of these platforms for this vertical. Marketers who can’t quantify their success are unable to optimize successful campaigns, pause poor-performing efforts, or justify the investment to their key stakeholders.\n\nThis might be due to the fact that many departments using marketing automation have been unsuccessful at integrating their new software with their existing CRM — or haven’t even tried to connect the two. When this happens, accurately tracking performance and ROI becomes extremely difficult at best, not to mention extremely labor-intensive. Further, siloing these two powerful pieces of software deepens the wedge between marketing and sales, eliminating efficiencies and causing further division between these historically-opposed departments.\n\nAct-On seamlessly integrates with several of the most popular CRMs — such as Salesforce, SugarCRM, NetSuite, and Microsoft Dynamics, among several others. Without ever having to leave their CRM, manufacturing marketers can now view each aspect of a prospect’s engagement history. This helps manufacturing marketers and sales professionals better track their website visitors, engage those visitors with more targeted, segmented content, prioritize hot leads, and identify and pursue real opportunities.\n\n\nH2: Download the Full State of Marketing Automation Report to See How You Stack Up!\n\nThe infographic above is awesome, but it only tells a fraction of the story.

Keeping your existing customers happy not only helps secure more referrals but also paves the way for more cross-sells and upsells.\n\nIn 2022, we decided to relaunch our Power-Up Series , which is a customer success program we paused during the pandemic. The relaunch transformed what was previously a basic webinar series into custom landing pages, office hours, and hands-on workshops.\n\nDuring the first year, 286 different accounts attended, and that attendance number jumped to 400 in 2023, which is a 140% increase. Customers who participated were more likely to stay with us – their retention rate went up by 25%.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for creative ways to improve your retention marketing, we’ve shared our framework for reaching more customers and keeping them happy.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Switching Platforms Made Easy\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Customer-Driven Marketing Strategy: The Three Parts\n\nHave you ever attended an event that provided high-level information only to find that once you got into actually doing the work, you were a little lost? Our refreshed Power-Up Series decided to tackle this challenge through a three-part framework:\n\nThe high-level webinar. The webinar is our “main event” and focuses on a topic we think our audience will love (more on that shortly). For example, if the topic is email deliverability , our experts provide a high-level overview.\n\nThe workshop. The workshop takes that high-level information and helps our customers apply it to their exact situation. Think about it like college: You attend the lecture and then attend labs to actually do the work.\n\nOffice hours. Speaking of college, we designed regular office hours to meet the customers where they’re at on any issue they need help with (not necessarily related to the current topic). Customers can bring their questions to our experts and work one-on-one to solve them.\n\nWe also created dedicated landing pages for each topic with additional resources, such as articles or guides. These pages receive a significant amount of traffic. In 2022, we had 1,985 views on the landing pages. In 2023, views jumped to 4,311, marking a 217% increase.\n\n\nH2: How We Find Topics Our Customers Love\n\nHow do you know what topics your customers will love? Of course, we started by partnering with Support about frequently asked questions. We use data and anecdotal feedback to guide our decisions, and we also look at:\n\nIndustry trends. What trends are happening in your industry right now? This is often a great starting point. For example, Google and Yahoo launched new requirements to help improve email security and user experience earlier this year. Our internal data showed deliverability is a popular topic with our customers, so we decided to do a Power-Up on the topic. Attendance broke our records for a single event, with 430 registrants.\n\nTraffic data. One of the great benefits of building a landing page for each Power-Up is that we can track traffic data to gauge customer interest. We use this data to determine what topics our audience needs help with and to guide future content creation.\n\nWebinar participant surveys. Asking your attendees to fill out a survey is a great way to understand how to improve on an existing topic and develop future retention marketing content. First party data is an underused intelligence source for marketers. Before relaunching the series, we sent an email survey post-webinar to gather feedback, but the response rate was low. With the relaunch, we took a new approach: survey attendees directly on the Zoom platform. The response rate increased to 25%.\n\nHere are some of the questions we asked:\n\n- Did you find this session beneficial?\n\n- What percentage of today’s webinar was new information to you?\n\n- Would you like more information about {X} topic?\n\n- Are there any other topics that would be helpful to you?\n\nWith this data, we could follow up with customers who want to learn more about a specific topic and use their feedback to guide future customer marketing efforts.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: In a conference room, a diverse group watches a customer retention marketing webinar on a screen]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retention-marketing-1-1024x796.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: In a conference room, a diverse group watches a customer retention marketing webinar on a screen]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retention-marketing-1-1024x796.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Tracking Attendance Rates and Planning\n\nWhen sending promotional emails for customer retention marketing webinars, the last thing you want is a poor response. That’s why we look at historical data to plan future events.\n\nHere’s what our internal data says:\n\n- Avoid July and August. Many of our customers are out for summer vacations.\n\n- Skip March. It’s often a time for spring break travel.\n\n- Pause during December. Everyone has checked out for the holidays, so we may as well wait until Q1.\n\nAlso, our internal webinar expert Kelsey Yen, has another tip for sending promotional emails .\n\n“I send my webinar promotional emails the same day of the week and time of day I plan to hold the event,” says Kelsey. “If engagement is high, it’s an early indicator that the time might work well for the audience.”\n\nWhen thinking about webinar marketing, you can also look at past email open rates to determine the day and time that typically works best for your customers.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: business person pumps fists in victory in a teal circle, illustrating the idea of retention marketing]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retention-marketing-2-1024x683.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: business person pumps fists in victory in a teal circle, illustrating the idea of retention marketing]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retention-marketing-2-1024x683.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Customer Retention Marketing and Adding Value\n\nFrom the moment customers decide to purchase our product, there’s a value exchange. We always want to be on the right side of that value exchange because once customers feel like they’re not getting enough, we’re at risk for retention problems.\n\nTo that point, I’ll share something we learned early in the Power-Up Series: Don’t sell. Whatever you create should be focused on helping your customers get the most from their existing products without any sales pitches. That idea alone could help improve any customer retention program.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Switching Platforms Made Easy\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\nAnd if you need help generating higher customer lifetime value and improving retention marketing , we have a webinar for you!

We’ll also explain how to use customer lifetime value to assess marketing effectiveness, diagnose common problems, and make smarter decisions.\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH2: What is Customer Lifetime Value?\n\nCustomer lifetime value is the total amount of revenue that you will receive over the course of your relationship with a specific customer. It hinges on how long, on average, you are able to keep customers.\n\nCustomer lifetime value is the key to figuring out what you’re actually gaining from each customer. If you’re great at getting deals to close and you’re making all of your monthly revenue goals, that’s fantastic. But if you’re having trouble retaining those customers that you worked so hard to get, you’re likely making much less revenue from each customer than you potentially could. The amount of money you’re truly getting out those deals is small, even if there are a lot of them. And depending on your business model, you might not see net profit on a customer until you’ve had them for a cycle or two.\n\n\nH2: How do you calculate CLV?\n\nStart with three questions that every B2B marketing organization should be able to answer (or at least know where to find the answer):\n\n- What is the average sales value of your first transaction with a customer?\n\n- How much do you typically make per year from a customer after the first purchase? (including cross-sell and upsell revenue)\n\n- How long does a typical customer continue to do business with you?\n\nFor example, a typical first sale of $20,000, a typical ongoing annual value of $5,000 and a typical customer lifespan of five years (or 5 * $5,000), yields a customer lifetime value of $45,000.\n\nThis formula can get much more complicated. Some marketers use net profit instead of simple revenue, apply a rate of discount to capture today’s value of future customer purchases, or factor interest into the equation.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Closeup of a notebook beside a keyboard with the words customer lifetime value and a graph sketched in]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shutterstock_1562549872-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Closeup of a notebook beside a keyboard with the words customer lifetime value and a graph sketched in]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shutterstock_1562549872-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: How do I know whether my customer lifetime value is good or bad?\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- How much did you spend to acquire a customer?\n\n- Do you typically generate significant revenue from return/repeat customers?\n\n- How much do you typically spend to maintain these ongoing customer relationships?\n\nOften, marketers calculate customer lifetime value based only upon the value of the first sale, underestimating the total value of the customer. Much of the value marketers get from calculating customer lifetime value comes from tracking the impact of ongoing marketing campaigns, customer service interactions, upsell & cross-sell programs, and other tactics designed to increase revenue. When you base customer lifetime value entirely on the first sale, you lose the ability to measure the success of these activities.\n\nCLV simply lets you see clearly what you’re getting out of a customer versus what you’ve put in. Having insight into your revenue streams can help you dictate your go-to-market strategy. Additionally, CLV helps you answer one of the most important questions anyone can ask about a business: Did it make more money from a customer than it spent to acquire that customer?\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH2: How can I use CLV to make my marketing more effective?\n\nA complete view of customer lifetime value allows you to track the impact of your customer onboarding, retention, upsell & cross-sell efforts, and loyalty programs. You can pull each of those levers, assess the results, and decide where to focus future efforts and investment.\n\nCustomer lifetime value has long been used to determine not just campaign effectiveness, but also to determine how much should be spent on marketing, on media buys, and other marketing investments. Marketers also work very hard to increase the value of a customer’s initial purchase. You don’t need a customer lifetime value to do that necessarily; average revenue per customer tells the story. Changes in initial deal value, however, often interact in interesting ways with changes in long-term customer value.\n\n\nH2: Connecting customer lifetime value with ideal customer profile\n\nYou can also use customer lifetime value to define your ideal customer profile, and pursue more customers that fit that profile. To do so, first identify and segment your ICP customers based on whatever metrics work for you and your business (industry, company size, etc.). Then, compare the customer lifetime value for that segment to your CLV on the whole. The difference should help you invest more in your ideal customers, or make the case to your leadership team that you need to do so.\n\nFinally, a clear view of customer lifetime value allows marketers to spot and fight back against “sloppy growth.” This is often a problem when marketers choose high-volume lead-gen tactics without considering where and how to protect lead quality. Often, these customers are the inverse image of a company’s “best customer” segment: They buy less initially, spend less after the first purchase, and are less likely to renew. Falling lifetime value is a signal to adjust your lead-gen programs to target your ideal customer more carefully.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Closeup of someone using a pen to calculate customer lifetime value in a notebook]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shutterstock_380979370-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Closeup of someone using a pen to calculate customer lifetime value in a notebook]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shutterstock_380979370-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Customer lifetime value can help you craft an accurate budget\n\nAccording to Ruth Stevens, President of eMarketing Strategy, “The expected lifetime value of a customer represents the maximum allowable acquisition cost of that customer. Then using those numbers, you can craft a marketing budget that is related to firm profitability versus some fussier method of budgeting for marketing expenses.”\n\nThe more predictable your revenue streams are, the better. If you know exactly how much money will be flowing through your company this year, next year, and beyond, you’re already off to a good start for budgeting and creating sustainable growth.\n\n\nH2: Marketing automation and lifetime value\n\nMarketing automation reports and dashboards make it quick and convenient to review and analyze tons of customer intelligence, including demographics, campaign engagement, website visits, and purchase history. This information – often available in real time – is helpful for identifying cross-selling and upselling opportunities – great ways to increase the value of your customers! Behavior history profiles can also uncover likely follow-up sale products based on each customer’s pre-purchase and post-purchase interactions.\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention",

        "content": "Rising ROI expectations, increased inflation, and decreased consumer spending all add up to a CMO role that is quickly evolving.\n\n“Surveys show CMOs are concerned about demonstrating ROI, with another significant challenge being the generation of leads,” says Jeff Day, SVP of Marketing at Act-On Software.\n\nAs CMOs create strategies to solve these challenges in the coming months, their role is also evolving. CMSWire surveyed 700+ marketers and found the future will require:\n\n- Increased cross-functional partnerships with sales\n\n- More pressure to improve customer experience\n\n- More robust data strategies\n\nAs leaders focus on these areas and build stronger customer acquisition, a few strategies can help increase success while navigating economic headwinds.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Switching Platforms Made Easy\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Cross-functional partnerships with sales and customer acquisition\n\nLeaders are familiar with the age-old rift between sales and marketing . The disconnect becomes especially apparent when it comes to missing revenue targets. You might hear things like:\n\n“Sales isn’t following up! We worked so hard to get those leads… .”\n\n“Marketing keeps sending us all these terrible leads; we’re sick of wasting our time!”\n\nHowever, this apparent challenge is actually a huge opportunity. And the key to capturing it is shifting from quantity to quality.\n\nWe recently talked with Kevin Butler, VP of Marketing & Strategy at Goose Digital.\n\nHe noted the need to consider MQLs in the context of your total addressable market (TAM). “When you look at your MQLs, does that number make sense with your TAM?” asks Kevin. “Your team might say, ‘We drove 4,000 leads this month.’ But what if there are only 200 companies in your target market? How is that possible?”\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Copy reads \"How marketing leaders say their role is changing, 35% more pressure to improve the customer experience, 28% customer lifetime value becoming more important, 23% too much focus on tech over message/strategy, Source CMSWire Insights State of the CMO Report 2023.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pipeilne-generation1-1024x535.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Copy reads \"How marketing leaders say their role is changing, 35% more pressure to improve the customer experience, 28% customer lifetime value becoming more important, 23% too much focus on tech over message/strategy, Source CMSWire Insights State of the CMO Report 2023.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pipeilne-generation1-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nPart of this goes back to your lead-scoring system and talking with your sales team to ask questions like:\n\nWhat’s a “good lead” for you?\n\nWhich leads are the easiest for you to make contact with and qualify?\n\nFor marketing, that might mean narrowing the focus to provide higher-quality leads, and sales might need to dive deeper and get specific about what makes a good lead.\n\n\nH2: Improving the customer experience and customer acquisition\n\nNot surprisingly, survey respondents said another key factor that would shape a CMO’s role in the future is the customer experience. However, according to leaders, when considering experience improvements, they face two major challenges:\n\n- Lack of budget\n\n- Difficulty measuring ROI in marketing\n\nJeff explains that “cautiously optimistic buyers expect more value from their purchases in the current environment.” Building that value starts with nurturing prospects and continues long after the purchase.\n\nAs prospects and customers explore your website, open your emails, and engage on social media, they leave “digital breadcrumbs.” Collecting and knowing how to use this data is your team’s gateway to improving the customer experience.\n\nFor example, if you sell marketing automation, perhaps an existing customer attends a webinar about email deliverability and then downloads an eBook on the same topic. Tracking that behavior, your team can trigger campaigns to send that customer the most relevant resources to build pipeline and future cross-sells and upsells.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Switching Platforms Made Easy\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\nYou can also track behavioral data to identify prospects with a high sense of urgency. For example, a prospect who visits a product pricing page several times in a single day might receive a message asking if they’d like to connect with a salesperson. Allowing the prospect to self-identify their needs helps improve the experience.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll want to reconsider how you’re collecting first-party data. Marketers often ask for information such as name, email address, and phone number when gating content. However, according to Kevin, they rarely collect answers to questions like:\n\n- When are you looking to make a purchase?\n\n- What is your greatest need?\n\nGathering this information helps you build a stronger marketing pipeline that focuses on quality instead of quantity. It also helps you provide a better customer experience by identifying prospect interest and intent early.\n\n\nH2: More robust data strategies and customer acquisition\n\nWhen asking marketing leaders about metric accountability, the survey found that:\n\n- 59% reported that leadership expects “marketing to have quantifiable, measurable results for everything in the department.”\n\n- 41% said that “leadership accepts that some of the goals may not have quantifiable results.”\n\nRegardless of how your leadership team approaches results, marketing teams still face budget concerns, doing more with less, and demands around scaling.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Copy reads: how marketing leaders say their role is changing, 43% demonstrating ROI, 35% increasing content production, 31% justifying budget, source CMSWire Insights State of the CMO Report 2023.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pipeline-generation2-1024x535.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Copy reads: how marketing leaders say their role is changing, 43% demonstrating ROI, 35% increasing content production, 31% justifying budget, source CMSWire Insights State of the CMO Report 2023.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pipeline-generation2-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nAs you work to overcome these challenges, marketing automation is a tool that helps you understand your audience’s needs, supports pipeline marketing, and provides sales with better leads .\n\nThe challenge is that many marketing teams use tools that don’t adequately support their needs .Gartner shows that only 33% of marketers fully use their martech stack , which means that many teams pay for capabilities they aren’t using (hardly a good thing when budgets are shrinking).\n\n“Martech vendors, racing to build bigger and better features, ended up with so much “extra stuff” in their suites that getting even the most basic work done—let alone anything complicated—became difficult,” says Jeff. “The result is frustration and wasted time.”\n\nThis frustration is likely why 23% of marketers report they switched their marketing automation solution for a better alternative.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, when you sit down with your CEO to discuss marketing strategies, they want to know:\n\nHow does this program, strategy, or campaign translate to dollars?\n\n“When you can leverage data-driven strategies with tools like marketing automation, it’s easier to answer that question,” says Jeff.  “But you want to use tools that have the capabilities you need, instead of paying for functionality you don’t want or need.”\n\nIf you’re concerned about the rising cost of operating your marketing automation along with increasing complexity, check out our free marketing automation assessment tool.

        "content": "Lead generation is on the to-do list of most marketers. And sure, you might have some successful strategies in place, but wouldn’t it be nice to capture some easier wins?\n\nOne of the best ways to land these wins is through customer marketing.\n\nWhy?\n\nCompanies have a 60% to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer, compared to a brand-new one (the latter is only 5% to 20%). Research also shows existing customers spend 67% more than new customers.\n\nThe bottom line is that existing customers are easier to sell to, and they buy more.\n\nSo, if you want to capture more of that revenue, a great place to start is customer marketing.\n\n\nH3: What is customer marketing?\n\nCustomer marketing is the strategy of continuing to actively market to your customers after you’ve made the initial sale by building relationships and improving your brand experience. Customer marketing helps promote retention, and foster upsells and cross-sells. The customers who know, love, and use your products are much more likely to purchase additional products and services in the future.\n\nAnd if they don’t love your products (yet), you want to provide value and help continuously, so when it comes time for renewal (or shopping the competitors), staying with your product will be the clear choice.\n\n\nH3: Why is customer-centric marketing important?\n\nThe cost of acquiring a new customer is roughly four to five times the cost of retaining an existing one. And yes, customer acquisition is important for growth, but if you don’t balance that with marketing to your existing customers, you can end up in a vicious cycle of churn and burn.\n\nHere’s what that looks like:\n\n- You onboard customer X.\n\n- You lose customer X.\n\n- You spend 4-5x more to replace customer X.\n\n- And the cycle grows longer and more expensive…\n\nCustomer relationship marketing helps you to correct this imbalance to retain more customers, upsell, and cross-sell to achieve a higher customer lifetime value .\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH3: What customer marketing strategies should I use?\n\nAs you create your customer-led marketing strategy, most organizations have a couple of primary goals.\n\n- Create happy customers. Why would they want to switch to a competitor? They love you!\n\n- Grow lifetime customer value. They love you so much that they’re presold when you recommend other products and services.\n\nHere are a few strategies for reaching these goals:\n\n\nH2: Personalize onboarding\n\nOnboarding email: “We’re really great. Our product is really great. Us, us, us… {continues with corporate speak and canned messaging}. ”\n\nThe customer’s response: Delete.\n\nOops, that didn’t go so well.\n\nLet’s try again.\n\nWhen your customer buys your product or service, you want to send them a personalized welcome email and onboarding series . The content should be specific to the product they purchased and give them resources, guides, and training that help them successfully use the product.\n\nAnd remember, once you create this email, don’t set it and forget it.\n\nContinue to talk to your customer service and salespeople. Ask about the problems that customers have during the onboarding process and then use that intelligence to create progressively better content.\n\n\nH2: Map your customer success journey\n\nMap out the specific journey your customers take after purchase. The first step, which we mentioned above, is that welcome email. Now, you’ll want to target a few more touch points. Here are several to consider adding to your list:\n\n- Adoption and training. Your customer is brand new when it comes to using your product; what do they need to know? Again, chat with your sales and customer service teams and ask questions about where new customers get stuck. Use the answers to these questions to create training and resources to solve common problems and support your new customers.\n\n- Help customers understand the overall value. Continue showing customers the great ways to use your product, and reinforce its value. For example,\n\n“Hey, customer, did you know you can do this cool thing? Customer X just recently grew revenue by Y% using this exact feature. Give it a try! Let us know how it works for you.”\n\nAnd here’s a pro tip: You can use marketing automation to set up these experiences .\n\n- Expand the relationship, cross-sell, and upsell. Once your customer has some wins with your products, consider telling them about complementary products and upsells. Explain how these solutions can help them continue to grow their success.\n\n- Ask for feedback. Don’t wait until you’re close to renewal to ask for feedback. Ask early and ask often. Then, take that feedback to your team, look for ways to improve the product or service, and let the customer know how you’re using their feedback.\n\nThese are just a few potential options, but the point is to start thinking about the customer journey and then set up touch points along that journey to create stronger relationships.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: customer marketing represented by a shipping client looking at content on his tablet]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/customer-marketing-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: customer marketing represented by a shipping client looking at content on his tablet]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/customer-marketing-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Segment users with similar characteristics\n\nWe can’t answer the question “What is consumer marketing?” without mentioning segmentation.\n\nThat’s because it’s the framework that allows you to personalize at scale.\n\nRemember that welcome email we mentioned earlier? You can use it to segment your customers even further and help them reach their goals. For example, if you sell marketing automation, you might ask the new customer about their goals during that first welcome email.\n\nLet’s say you learn their primary goal is to grow revenue through email marketing. You can use that data to segment new customers by interest and then provide personalized training, tools, and resources targeted to email marketing. Or you might discover a top interest is improving email deliverability. As a result, you send a comprehensive guide written by your internal gurus on the topic (by the way, we actually wrote that guide! You can check it out here ).\n\nWhen your customers reach their goals faster, your retention strategies will be more effective, and they’ll naturally want to grow their relationship with you.\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH2: Measuring your results\n\nAs with any marketing strategy, you’ll want to show results, right? And while customer marketing metrics are tricky to track since programs happen over a long period, you can still track them. A couple of metrics to consider include:\n\nLifetime customer value (LCV). LCV is the total revenue generated from a single customer throughout your entire relationship with them. For example, if a customer spends $100 per purchase, makes five purchases per year, and has been with your company for three years, their LCV would be $100 x 5 x 3 = $1,500.\n\nROI. With ROI, you measure the profitability of your customer marketing efforts as related to their cost. For example, if a customer marketing campaign costs $10,000 and generates $50,000 in revenue, your ROI would be ($50,000 – $10,000 / $10,000) * 100 = 400%.\n\nNew customer acquisition will undoubtedly be part of your marketing strategy in the future. But when you balance that strategy with powerful customer marketing efforts, you can make faster strides toward growth because you won’t be battling churn.\n\nDo you want to know more tricks for keeping customers?
