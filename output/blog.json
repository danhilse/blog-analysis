And many say that while expectations for ROI are increasing, their budgets are not .\n\nHardly seems fair, right?\n\nA recent survey of marketers by MarTech.org found that, of those surveyed:\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A data graphic that reads,\n\"41% say they feel the pressure to measure ROI\n14% say the pressure makes them want to pull their hair out\n27% say the pressure to measure ROI is overwhelming]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AO_SocialAds_FeelTheHeat_Illustration-1024x768.jpg\n\n\nAn effective way to improve ROI is focusing on strategic changes in your nurture campaigns to build stronger pipeline. Want a few ideas for getting started? We’ve shared our favorite five lead nurturing examples and strategies.\n\n\nH2: Audit existing email nurture campaigns for performance\n\nDo you have engagement programs scheduled to kick off after a prospect attends a webinar, downloads content, or takes other actions with your brand?\n\nIf so, that’s a great first step. The second is figuring out how to make those lead nurturing campaigns work harder.\n\nBegin by checking your open rates.\n\nFor example, we did a complete audit of our nurture sequences last year and found the open rate was around 25%. That’s a decent performance, but there was an opportunity to improve.\n\nOur internal guru, Kelsey Yen, revamped our nurture campaigns, and our open rate jumped from 25% to 48%. Our clickthrough rates increased from 1.32% to 17.93%.\n\nNot bad, right?\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of what Kelsey did:\n\n1. Inventoried what we had. She looked at the current program metrics to determine which messaging worked and which didn’t.\n\n2. Aligned with intent and the buyer’s journey. As she looked through the data, she also figured out which messaging performed best with our target ICP but also aligned with where a person was in their journey (top of funnel, middle of funnel, or bottom of funnel).\n\n3. Created streams based on how people entered the database. She accounted for how each person entered our database. Did they download an eBook, attend a webinar, or do something else? The goal was to capture the data to ensure they were tagged appropriately to get into the correct nurture sequence .\n\nOf course, this is a quick summary of the process. We published the full details here , if you want to check them out and apply the strategies to your own nurture campaigns.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: a woman holds her glassses as she collaborates with a male coworker on a laptop, yellow and teal graphics highlight the black and white image as well as iconography]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AO_SocialAds_FeelTheHeat_Header_1-1024x535.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Focus on nurturing your silent prospects\n\nObviously, you want to focus on the prospects taking action and proactively moving through their buyer’s journey, but what about the prospects who won’t budge?\n\nFocusing on nonaction prospects is an underrated strategy, and here’s why: It’s not always about the actions prospects take; sometimes it’s about the actions they don’t take.\n\nImagine a known prospect visiting your product page but not performing the desired action. And when we say “known,” we mean they’ve interacted with your brand in the past , so you have their email address (courtesy of your marketing automation platform ).\n\nYou can use that nonaction for a trigger email and to kick off a campaign.\n\nMaybe this means sending the prospect an appropriate eBook based on their interests or sending a related webinar replay. The goal is to keep the conversation going. You want to turn that nonaction prospect into an engaged prospect.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Go deeper with your existing customers through lead nurturing\n\nGrowing customer lifetime value (CLV) isn’t a new concept to marketers.\n\nYet only 25% of marketers rank customer lifetime value (CLV) among their top five marketing metrics.\n\nAnd here’s something else to consider: Research shows that while most businesses make sales to between 5% and 20% of new customers, they close deals with 60% to 70% of existing customers.\n\nEmail nurture campaigns can help you go deeper with your existing customers and grow your CLV. Here’s a few ideas:\n\n1. Segmented product recommendations. Use customer data to segment your audience based on their buying history and current behavior. Then send targeted content to them based on the data, to encourage related purchases.\n\n2. Design reengagement campaigns. Target inactive or dormant customers by sending personalized messages with exclusive content, limited-time offers, or other premiums based on past interests.\n\n3. Ask for feedback. As you work to nurture leads, consider asking for input about your products or services. For example, let’s say you offer a marketing automation solution. You might ask: what do you wish you could do when creating nurture campaigns that you currently can’t? Maybe the customer wants help coming up with good subject lines because it’s time-consuming (by the way, we actually created that feature ). You can now use that feedback during product iteration and updates.\n\nThese three areas are excellent opportunities to showcase additional product or content recommendations and fill the pipeline with new opportunities.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: a group of diverse markters huddle at a laptop, image is black and white with blue accents and iconography of software superimposed]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AO_SocialAds_FeelTheHeat_Header_2-1024x535.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Design nurture campaigns based on lead scoring\n\nA Gartner study found that businesses using lead scoring experienced a 77% increase in ROI with lead generation.\n\nThe research also revealed that 70% of leads are lost due to inadequate follow-up.\n\nLead scoring allows you to master the follow-up.\n\nLead scoring can trigger emails about scheduling a call or booking a demo for your “hot leads.” For example, Starshot’s team uses Act-On’s precision lead scoring capability to automate the process, enabling them to focus on marketing-identified “hot” opportunities and move leads through the pipeline faster and more strategically.\n\nA warm lead might receive relevant content such as a case study, a white paper, or other educational content. And a cold lead might trickle into a nurture campaign focused on reengagement. You can then offer them highly personalized content based on where they are in their journey.\n\n\nH2: Launch an educational nurture campaign\n\nHave you ever purchased a product, got excited about using it, and immediately run into frustrating roadblocks?\n\nYeah, us too!\n\nWhen this happens with one of your customers, you run the risk of churn and the loss of future revenue opportunities.\n\nYou can combat this challenge with educational nurture campaigns.\n\nDesign your campaign with common customer challenges in mind.\n\nIf you aren’t clear on the challenges, talk with your customer service and sales folks. They’ll have plenty of ideas! Then create educational content, blog posts, eBooks, or webinars to address those challenges and build loyalty and satisfaction.\n\n\nH3: Bigger budgets would be nice, but in the meantime …\n\nThe rest of us are just working smarter. And part of that strategy can include nurture campaigns designed to build a stronger pipeline .\n\nAs you work to achieve that, consider that lead nurturing software, such as marketing automation, helps you get there faster and easily show ROI.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult.

Why?\n\nIt’s often the quality of the leads.\n\nAnd that quality is tied closely to strategy. An effective way to level up strategy and get better results is account-based marketing (ABM). ABM is reported to give 87% of the marketers that use it a higher ROI. These marketers also report shorter sales cycles, and who doesn’t want shorter sales cycles, right?\n\nBut marketers aren’t getting these results by accident.

        "content": "Shrinking budgets, rising expectations, and a growing disconnect between CEOs and CMOs about the “most important” marketing metrics lead to more questions than answers about how to expand pipeline.\n\nAccording to a recent report , the probability of CEOs and marketing leaders agreeing on top marketing metrics is like a flip of a coin (50/50).\n\nBut despite a growing disconnect, most can agree on one important priority: revenue growth . And achieving that is rooted in supporting pipeline expansion.\n\nWe tapped Jeff Day, SVP of Marketing at Act-On Software, and Kevin Butler, VP of Marketing & Strategy at Goose Digital, to share their favorite strategies marketing leaders can use to help sales build a pipeline in 2024. When considering the future, both are very optimistic about market changes, trends, and the opportunities they provide marketers who understand how to leverage them to create an advantage.\n\n\nH2: How marketing can help sales nurture prospects to create opportunities\n\nRelevance to your audience’s needs, aligning it with your lead nurture efforts, and following up effectively are critical areas of focus when building a marketing pipeline, according to Jeff.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Graphic with headshot and Act-On logo and a quote, \"If you know a prospect is coming to you from a Google ad on a specific topic, like lead scoring, follow up with lead-scoring content rather than hitting them up right away for a demo,” Jeff Day Senior VP of Marketing at Act-On]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marketing-expand-sales-pipeline-2-1024x535.jpg\n\n\n“If you know a prospect is coming to you from a Google ad on a specific topic, like lead scoring, follow up with lead-scoring content rather than hitting them up right away for a demo,” says Jeff.\n\nKevin, who leads Goose Digital’s strategy and marketing team, spends his days helping businesses figure out how to compete and win with their target audiences. He explains that it’s important to understand need and intent early.\n\nPart of doing this well involves strategically leveraging first-party data about your audience. For example, marketers often ask for basic information, such as name, email address, and phone number, on forms, but rarely do they ask these two questions:\n\n1. When are you looking to make a purchase?\n\n2. What is your greatest need?\n\nCapturing this data helps you understand a buyer’s intent and needs from the outset. He also explains that following up with previously lost prospects is a commonly overlooked strategy.\n\n“When we lose a sale, we often close the book and move on, but that’s a huge missed opportunity,” he says. “For example, if you’re in an industry where one-year contracts are typical, circle back to that lost prospect before their next renewal date and ask how things are going.”\n\n\nH2: Building sales pipeline with a focus on quality over quantity\n\nAs you consider how to deliver the best leads to sales, one strategy is central to improving results:\n\nQuality over quantity.\n\nOftentimes, metrics are based on the quantity of MQLs. But Jeff, who oversees Act-On’s marketing and BDR teams, explains that volume doesn’t matter if the quality isn’t great.\n\nKevin suggests considering MQLs in the context of your total addressable market (TAM). “When you look at your MQLs, does that number make sense with your TAM?” asks Kevin. “Your team might say, ‘We drove 4,000 leads this month.’ But what if there are only 200 companies in your target market? How is that possible?”\n\nWith respect to MQLs, one additional consideration Kevin mentions is the importance of correlation of MQLs to qualified pipeline sales opportunities. “MQLs can be effective indicators of success, but ultimately markerters need to validate consistent conversion from MQLs into real opportunities your sales team can work with.”\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Graphic with headshot and Act-On and Goose Digital logos illustrating the quote, \"If you know a prospect is coming to you from a Google ad on a specific topic, like lead scoring, follow up with lead-scoring content rather than hitting them up right away for a demo,” Jeff Day Senior VP of Marketing at Act-On]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marketing-expand-sales-pipeline-1-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nImproving the quality of your leads goes back to your lead-scoring system. How do you set them up? And how do you pass only the highest-quality leads to your sales team and ensure BDR teams follow up in a personalized and more meaningful way?\n\nMastering this challenge is where you can gain traction for driving the best leads to your sales teams and expand pipeline.\n\n\nH2: How marketing and sales work together with account intelligence\n\nKevin explains that while it’s the salesperson’s job to close the deal, it’s marketing’s job to give them the “tools” to do so. “We’ve got to arm them with all the information we can so they can do what they are good at, and part of that is providing the right data.”\n\nIn other words, marketing needs to make it easy on sales. And doing that means the prospect comes with all the relevant background details, packaged and ready to use.\n\n“A salesperson should be able to look in the system and say, “Okay, I see the background details; let’s schedule a discovery call,” says Jeff. “And what’s the discovery call about? Okay, I see it here; these are the ‘magic pillars’ I need to address.”\n\nAnd by magic pillars, he means the areas most relevant to the prospect based on the content and previous interactions with your brand.\n\n\nH3: Email Marketing Migration: Switching Platforms Made Easy\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Scaling demand generation operations and pipeline marketing\n\nSurprisingly, there are many teams still manually sending out marketing campaigns or creating single follow up sequences. But shrinking budgets and heavier demands on marketing teams require scalability.\n\n“Don’t set up small things,” says Jeff. “Think about how to set up a trigger campaign based on a prospect viewing a certain piece of content, for example. Then, once they exit that sequence, they filter into an evergreen nurture sequence.”\n\nThe goal is to personalize based on intent and need and build stronger connections at scale. Marketing automation is a big part of that scalability, but it’s important that teams learn to use it and start asking important questions such as: How effective are my emails? Would changing the subject line , CTA , or something else result in better performance?\n\nRun experiments. Pinpoint success. And then use tools like marketing automation to scale and expand that success.\n\n\nH2: Uncover trends that give your team a competitive advantage\n\nMarketing leaders watch trends carefully, but the tricky part is figuring out how to leverage those trends to expand pipeline. Jeff and Kevin called out a few when asked which trends to watch this year.\n\n- Niche communities grow in importance. According to Kevin, buyers are “going dark” for longer periods of time before becoming known to brands. During these dark periods, they gather intelligence about solutions that address their challenges independently and spend more time in niche communities talking with peers with similar challenges and experiences. “If your target market is spending time in a community, being involved with it will be worth its weight in gold,” says Kevin.\n\n- Recognizing the broader capabilities of AI. Obviously, 2023 was a big year for AI, with ChatGPT hitting the scene. However, according to Jeff, we have to think about AI not only for generative content but also for its broader capabilities like predictive scoring and workflow automation. These help marketers get more value, move faster, and deploy campaigns quicker.\n\n- Google and Yahoo changes highlight the importance of quality over quantity. Quality over quantity will be important in nurturing campaigns with the most recent Yahoo and Google rules . Kevin suggests that marketing scrutinize their lists carefully. They need to understand who is opening emails and who isn’t and pay careful attention to disengaged prospects, because your emails to them could be labeled as spam. He adds, “Remember, it’s not about the size of your list. It’s about the quality and engagement of your list.”\n\n\nH3: Email Marketing Migration: Switching Platforms Made Easy\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult.

        "content": "Using your own data is the best way to combat the loss of third-party cookies in all three of the world’s major browsers (Safari, Firefox and most recently, Chrome). This article is a practical guide to navigating first-party data – the data you collect on your own website(s) and/or digital products. As we move into an era of heightened expectations for both privacy and personalization, one of the most important mentality shifts will be away from reliance on third-party cookies , toward capturing and using first-party data more effectively.\n\n\nH2: How to Personalize in the Age of Internet Privacy\n\nThe world’s major browsers have taken steps to protect their user’s data , and in doing so, set themselves up to be in control of such data when intent-based campaigns need to continue somehow. Since there is big money to be made in advertising to ready-to-buy consumers, the idea of tracking behavior isn’t going to go away entirely, but it will shift. And, access to such data may come at a premium. Right now, the best way to react is to investigate how to connect with your customers first-hand.\n\nWith 80% of consumers preferring companies that offer a personalized experience, first-party data can help you combat fears around the death of third-party cookies . Creating personalized experiences starts with understanding who your customers are and what they need.\n\n\nH3: The Role of Segmentation in Personalization\n\nIn order to personalize your communication with leads and customers, you first have to have the right data. Then, you can segment people into specific categories based on factors including:\n\n- Behavioral segmentation. Identifying behavior patterns and then segmenting visitors helps you serve relevant and targeted content to keep customers engaged. This can include product recommendations, promotions, marketing messages, and more.\n\n- Demographic segmentation. Factors like age, income, and background can help you serve content depending on each website visitor’s individual demographics. One downside of demographic segmentation is that it’s generally based on broad assumptions, so it can’t be used for specific content.\n\n- Psychographic segmentation. Drilling down into the beliefs and values of your website visitors can help you create tailored marketing messages and promotions that speak to your customer as an individual. This kind of data is more challenging to collect than others, but it’s worth doing.\n\n- Geographic segmentation. Depending on a visitor’s geographic location, you can redirect them to a regional site, show them relevant products, and engage them with offers tailored to their specific needs.\n\nThe most effective strategy is to combine all four segmentation categories to provide high-value, relevant content to your leads and customers. For example, targeted ads based on keywords and website behavior can increase engagement by up to 45%.\n\nIn this article, we’ve looked at five of the most effective ways to capture and use your first-party data. Let’s start with tracking behaviors on your own website.\n\n\nH2: Tracking Website Behavior\n\nAdding tracking pixels to your website allows you to collect information about how people behave when they visit your website. Setting up your website correctly can help you collect data that can help you offer better experiences, and guide the right leads through the exact funnel they need to experience in order to be ready to buy. Even better, once that visitor has converted on any form, your marketing automation software can log that activity and connect it with their profile so you can start to build an accurate picture of their interests.\n\nTracking website behavior allows you to see visits to each page, and other details, like how long someone stays on that page. You can also get data like geographic location and device type, as well as click and scroll patterns, all of which appear in aggregate in your website reporting.\n\n\nH3: Using Aggregate Data to Improve Experiences\n\nA whole world of optimization opportunities opens up when you have website behavior data. Combine the data you get from Google Analytics (or other website reporting platform) with your marketing automation software, and you’ll be able to understand more about the paths people take through your content, and how well it performs. Tools like Hotjar and Lucky Orange provide visualizations of how visitors interact with your website, commonly called heatmaps.\n\nLet’s say your data shows, for example, that only 20% of your visitors scroll past the halfway point on your homepage, but of those who do, a great many watch your brand video, and nearly 80% of those viewers fill out your form to get more information. What should you do? Move that brand video up higher on the page, and see if more of your visitors will watch it, and then follow that proven conversion pattern.\n\n\nH3: Incorporating Website Behavior Into Lead Scoring Programs\n\nCollecting your own data on your website provides the foundation you need to build or optimize your lead scoring system. The scores will outline visits to specific pages, i,e: contact us, pricing page, or get a demo. Using a scoring system will help your integrated marketing team better qualify leads and guide customers down the funnel.\n\nWhile your assumptions may sometimes be correct, seeing a clearly defined customer behavior path can give you key insights into what will affect their intent in the future. These insights make way for a more personalized approach, connecting your product with your customers’ needs.\n\n\nH2: Tracking Email Engagement\n\nEmail is a powerful tool for  B2B marketers who want to decrease their reliance on third-party data. Because users have to actively opt-in to receive your emails, you know they’re already interested in engaging with your brand. With email generating a return on investment (ROI) of $42 for every dollar spent , it’s worth taking the time to perfect this strategy. Remember that increased privacy around email marketing will affect your open rate data.\n\nA lot of information can be gathered from the links each user clicks within your email content. If they typically show more interest in links around a specific topic, you can use this information to serve increasingly tailored content. You may decide to recommend additional articles around the same topic or invite them to download a case study about their specific industry or attend an on-demand webinar.\n\nAs your emails drive clicks back to your website, you can combine email engagement data with behavioral data collected by your website to further engage each customer. Use your marketing automation software to segment into users who prefer long-form versus infographic style posts and offer a curated experience that keeps readers coming back for more.\n\nYour emails should also be specific to a particular audience—what interests one segment won’t necessarily interest another. Targeted emails will be more effective at retaining interest and engagement. Using A/B testing to figure out which content resonates best with whom is a good way to gather additional data that can be used to refine future campaigns.\n\n\nH2: Tracking Event Registration and Attendance\n\nEvents like live videos, on-demand webinars, and virtual summits are an excellent opportunity to collect event-based first-party data, which can be used to further refine your offers. Live videos are also becoming more popular than ever, with 96% of people using videos to learn more about a specific product or service before engaging with a sales team.\n\nCollecting email addresses when people register to watch on-demand webinars is the first step, but you can also include custom data fields that help you to gain a deeper understanding of your audience’s goals. Over time, this allows you to carry out progressive profiling so you can understand your customers even better.\n\nHowever, the way you register attendees for your events is important, as you’ll need to balance data collection with keeping the customer journey as seamless as possible. Lengthy registration forms for individual events may turn attendees off from the very first moment. Instead, one-click registration allows your audience to easily sign up for other events in the future without having to input their details again. Use your marketing automation platform’s progressive profiling capabilities to enable quick and easy registration.\n\nFor in-person events, it’s also possible to use website behavior data to promote in-person events. Website visitors within the same geographic region visiting pages with similar content can be made aware of events via targeted ads, pop-ups, or emails if they’re already subscribed to your list.\n\nWhen attendees RSVP to an event, you can segment your audience into who’s coming and who’s not. You can then apply further filters and create tailored emails designed to build excitement or to offer additional information to those who have already confirmed they’ll be attending.\n\n\nH2: Tracking Interactions with Your Team\n\nAs prospects interact with your team, they provide a huge amount of first-party data that can be used to boost retention, upsell, and improve the customer journey at the same time. You’re likely already using customer relationship management (CRM) software, and these often come with a huge range of tools, some of which use first-party data. First-party data can also be linked to offline interactions including in-person events and sales calls, in which case it’s useful to log these on your CRM to gain deeper insights into customer behavior.\n\nThe live touchpoints in your customer journey are normally very good indicators of buyer intent, and can make or break your B2B sales funnel. Use data about when and how people end up buying after these interactions to optimize the pathway and grow your business.\n\n\nH2: Tracking Product Use or Purchases\n\nPurchases and product use are the next layer of the customer journey. Gaining insight into what your customers purchase, how often they use your software, or how and when they purchase add ons or upgrades can be a key part of successful customer retention. To get the full benefit, it’s a good idea to integrate your CRM, ERP or other customer and order tracking system with your marketing automation platform.\n\nTo nurture long lasting and profitable relationships with your customers, start by collecting data on what they buy, and how they use your products and services. Then, analyze that data to uncover opportunities for optimization. One example is a community bank that signs up a new customer with a checking account, and uses customer data to understand when that person may be ready to hear about home loan options.\n\n\nH2: Take Control with First-Party Data\n\nTransitioning towards reliance on your own data gives you the freedom to create a truly sustainable marketing strategy that’s respectful of your customer’s data in addition to allowing you to meet expectations for a personalized user experience. From tracking website behavior, to understanding buying patterns, there is a lot your own team can do to combat the death of third-party cookies. The key is to have the right marketing tech stack in place to help you accomplish your data goals, because you need a way to capture and act upon your data. The most successful companies in the world combine a website CMS (like WordPress) with a marketing automation solution (like Act-On), and a CRM (like Salesforce) among other specialized tools. Gathering and analyzing firsthand data is the only way to ensure you are segmenting and personalizing your way to business growth, even in the age of increased privacy .",

        "content": "The email inbox is a deeply personal space. In 2009, HBR compared it to an underwear drawer — “We all have one and are all embarrassed by both its organization and contents.”\n\nNow, fast forward 15 years: every email tends to be a personal space. My email from Brand A can look totally different from yours — we each see different subject lines, headers, images, or content themes.\n\nPersonalization has become the norm in B2C email marketing. And B2B teams are increasingly segmenting and personalizing content for different buyer personas and customer journeys.\n\nYet, certain myths around email personalization persist — outdated truths, overreactions, or just flat-out misconceptions. But any myth that prevents marketing teams from personalizing email can damage opens, engagement, and revenue.\n\nSo in collaboration with Litmus, we’re busting up some myths in this two-part series on email personalization. Once you’re done here, hop over to the Litmus blog for part two .\n\n\nH2: Myth 1: People are creeped out by email personalization\n\nRemember when Target made headlines for knowing a teenage girl was pregnant before her parents did ? That viral story dates way back to 2012 — when the general public was beginning to realize how companies were collecting and using their data. Understandably, people were shocked and outraged. It was the truest example of personalization gone wrong.\n\nTimes have changed. These days, leaving an item in your shopping cart in the hopes of triggering an abandoned-cart discount offer is a smart money-saving tip , not a sign of intrusive marketing.\n\nAccording to McKinsey , 71% of consumers expect companies to deliver personalized interactions. And 69% of customers appreciate personalization, if it’s based on data they’ve explicitly shared.\n\nB2B buyers bring this mindset to work. Personalized messages now signal relevance — when the company behind an email knows who their recipients are and what they care about, it’s a good thing. This bears out in our own email testing: using the recipient’s first name and the company’s name in the subject line drove an average 83% improvement in click-to-open rates .\n\nPersonalization is no longer creepy — it’s table stakes.\n\n\nH2: Myth 2: Email personalization = first name (and that’s it)\n\nShallow personalization is easy to spot. We’ve all received the equivalent of a “Hi Matt,” (or the embarrassing “Hi [FirstName]”) opener on an email that otherwise contained zero personalized messages. It falls flat, every time.\n\nInserting a first name is the default option for teams who are just trying to check a box — but email personalization can and should go much deeper.\n\nBy segmenting your audience and customizing your content, you can personalize email to deliver meaningful relevance:\n\n- Tailor the subject line or headline to their department\n\n- Create differentiated messages for different job titles, referencing distinct pain points for individual contributors, managers, or executives\n\n- Link to case studies from other companies in their industry\n\n- Dynamically recommend content similar to what they’ve browsed or clicked on before\n\n- Map your content to the customer journey — use nurture sequences designed to gradually send more in-depth information as they click, download, or otherwise interact with your content\n\nThis helps your emails meet your contacts where they are, with content they actually care about.\n\n[FirstName] will thank you.\n\n\nH2: Myth 3: Email personalization is difficult to implement\n\nOn the other hand: just because deep personalization is possible doesn’t mean it’s an all-or-nothing proposition. You can drive a lot of value without an enormous amount of effort.\n\nTeams ready to go beyond “Hi FirstName” can start small and strategically, such as:\n\n1. Curate a targeted list of prospects based on two or three criteria — maybe an important title within a high-value industry.\n\n2. Create one customized campaign with personalized subject lines, messaging, and suggested content. Just one campaign — you can do it.\n\n3. Measure how your personalized campaign’s success rates compare to your baseline to see what’s working and what’s not.\n\n4. Once you learn what’s successful, duplicate the process for your highest-value segments.\n\nEveryone else can stay in the “generic” bucket until you make your way down the priority list. You’ll learn as you go, while driving meaningful results.\n\nYou can also start by personalizing content based on how people enter your database. This was our approach when we revamped our own nurture sequences in 2023. Our campaign clickthrough rate soared from 1.32% to 17.93% .\n\nFinally, technology makes this work much easier. Most marketing automation platforms (like Act-On) have segmentation capabilities, while email marketing tools like Litmus Personalize provide easy ways to automate dynamic content. GenAI can also be helpful — give your email to a writing tool like ChatGPT or Jasper, and ask it to tailor different versions for specific personas.\n\n\nH3: Email Marketing Myths Debunk’d\n\n\nH3: When it comes to email marketing tips, there are a few things that we have all been told to do. From using specific CTAs to sending at certain times of the day, but does some of that conventional wisdom really make a difference? After extensive tests, see what we uncovered.\n\n\nH2: Myth 4: Privacy regulations make email personalization impossible\n\nDigital marketing has, thankfully, come a long way since the days of inadvertent pregnancy announcements. Consumer privacy protections, from GDPR to Apple’s Mail Privacy Protection , now restrict how brands can monitor, gather, buy, or sell consumer data. They’ve also inspired a lot of doom-and-gloom headlines about the end of third-party cookies .\n\nBut email personalization is alive and well, thanks to zero-party data and first-party data . This is data your prospects explicitly share (like form fills or survey responses), or that you collect on your own channels (like webpage visits or content downloads). And it’s incredibly useful for email personalization.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A lead fills out a form to download our ebook on marketing analytics, giving their company name and title\n\n- We share additional content tailored to their role\n\n- They eventually click on and read our buying guide for marketing analytics platforms\n\n- We use lead scoring to track their buying journey — and automatically hand them over to sales\n\nThis is email personalization, powered by reputable zero- and first-party data.\n\nOne caveat here: make sure you have white-hat, double opt-in signup processes in place. This ensures your recipients actually want to hear from you, and prevents inactive subscribers who never open your emails — potentially harming your overall email deliverability .\n\n\nH2: Myth 5: Personalization is limited to copy alone\n\nBack to our earlier “FirstName” myth. Since copy is the most frequent form of personalization, many people think it’s the only way to customize content. But messaging is only the tip of the personalization iceberg.\n\nYou can also tailor email experiences with:\n\n- Colors — In ABM campaigns, reflect the brand’s visual identity back with customized color palettes\n\n- Images — Populate distinct header images for industries, locations, or other segments\n\n- Send time — Customize each recipient’s send time based on their last open (Act-On’s adaptive send feature takes care of this for you)\n\n- Interest signals — Provide social proof by displaying live click totals, showing subscribers what products or content are driving the most engagement\n\n- Countdown timers — Include a live countdown to a webinar or event to create urgency\n\n- Dynamic live polls — Include a poll with in-email results that update as users respond to the poll\n\nWith the right tools and strategies in place, the sky’s the limit when it comes to email personalization.\n\n\nH2: But what about…\n\nEmbarrassing errors? Measuring results? And driving actual ROI?\n\nFor more myth-busting mayhem, we’ve pulled in our pals at Litmus (some of the smartest email marketers we know).

        "content": "Demand generation strategy, aka demand gen, isn’t only about generating a ton of leads. Nope. It’s also about the quality of those leads — because it’s totally possible to generate huge lead volumes and still come up empty-handed.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen there’s a mismatch between lead quantity and lead quality, it hampers your sales efforts, leaving your sales team spinning their wheels, working bad leads.\n\nAt the same time, marketers face increased pressure from executives to tie marketing efforts to revenue . And that’s where solid demand generation strategies come into play.\n\n\nH2: What is a demand generation strategy?\n\nA demand-generation strategy creates interest or awareness about your products or services. It includes a variety of efforts, such as content marketing, social media, and more. The goal is to attract prospects, drive awareness, and convert leads.\n\nSuccessful demand generation strategies are measured by:\n\n- The quality of your leads.\n\n- What you’re able to convert to revenue.\n\n- The ability to prove your contribution to your company’s bottom line.\n\nDemand generation is powerful because it can help shorten the sales cycle and produce more revenue, which is directly attributed to specific actions. But, of course, it starts with figuring out how to best reach and help your target audience.\n\n\nH2: Demand gen vs. lead gen\n\nDemand generation is focused on creating awareness and interest in your products and services. Lead generation is focused on collecting information from potential customers who have shown interest. In other words, demand gen lays the foundation for generating interest, and lead generation focuses on converting that interest to potential leads.\n\nThe two work hand in hand, which is why you need solid B2B demand generation strategies to get the best results.\n\n\nH2: 7 Tactics to improve your demand generation strategy\n\nGetting a prospect to take action. That’s what you want, right? Yeah, us too. But that won’t happen unless you can walk with them along their journey from awareness to consideration to finally making that purchase.\n\nBut first, you must be found. And then, you need to know exactly where your customer is every step of the way, so you can give them what they need. Easy, right?\n\nMaybe, when you know exactly what to do. Here are seven strategies to help you get there.\n\n\nH3: 1. Optimize your website for SEO\n\nWhen a prospect has a pain point, they search for a solution. And when they do this, you want them to find you. Of course, that’s what SEO and picking the right keywords are all about — getting found. Today, improving your SEO is one of the most essential demand generation tactics. But if you’re a marketer, you probably know that already, right?\n\nHowever, when using SEO for your website, it’s also critical to consider the search intent of keywords. A person searching “best email marketing platform” will bring you far more targeted traffic than a person searching “best email.”\n\nSo make sure your website is full of the right keywords, free of HTTP error codes, and structured in a way that helps you stay on the good side of search engines.\n\n\nH3: 2. Gate your best content\n\nIt takes moments for a visitor to close their browser. But before they do, you want to earn the chance to engage with them again. A great way to do this is by creating high-value gated content.\n\nAre you already doing it? Great. But it’s still worth taking a fresh look at two areas.\n\n- Relevance. Is the gated content still relevant to your target audience? Does it still speak to their most important pain points? Is there something that would work better?\n\n- Personalization. Once a prospect hands you their email, do you have a personalized nurturing sequence to keep them engaged?\n\nFor example, as part of our demand generation strategy, we created an in-depth eBook about how B2B marketers can attract more high-quality leads. We include our favorite insider tips and offer the download in related blogs to help our audience improve their results.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Screenshot of ebook showing best demand generation strategies.]\nSource: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qy86K1sQQqvPwPK2u8Lt0oj06miODdQ1Q5KCf04pzmN1_GwVpUP09syr1oTyetBjjS-hnTXLFWOnDfdv7INqHhfksGTg8aApRXkiNqQeDhuRA50jrhOTbWhdiGKt-aAhDKbGlV2EvbzI3iN45AIPxpg\n\n\n\nH3: 3. Use website personalization\n\nPersonalized experiences. Customers don’t just want them … they demand them. And if you don’t deliver, it’s hard to create that connection that keeps people engaged and coming back for more. A demand generation tactic that helps you get there faster is website personalization.\n\nAnd yes, it’s true: Website personalization has been around for years, but previously it was complicated, expensive, and out of reach for many B2B marketers (especially if you worked for a smaller company). That’s all changed though.\n\nWebsite personalization provides intelligent content recommendations to engage various audience segments. It uses AI and machine learning to deliver a customized journey that helps prospects move through the sales cycle faster.\n\n\nH3: 4. Engage in the right places\n\nAre you serving customers in the B2B space? If so, you want to hang out in the same places they are to boost your lead gen efforts. A great starting point is LinkedIn, since over 90% of B2B content marketers report LinkedIn as an effective distribution channel.\n\nHere at Act-On, we know our target audience (B2B marketers) spends a decent amount of time on LinkedIn, so we often use it to promote content that will help them with their challenges (like this recent post we did to promote a Demand Gen webinar).\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Screenshot shows a LinkedIn post to illustrate the demand generation strategy of engaging audiences in their preferred channels.]\nSource: https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/52HBWBLhdMEKnOhd-ZVApymSGjTl43ZWAHauCA79-KSJIo-Nnuk5oNSmMKPezZiYS2C4iSExXbfvCOlS0xazU2dN4IN7aryov-W0RShUY8xt7iAf-mVZEsvTIXCoHvDjogsYHukK00gYAQT9LJWhGRU\n\n\nA social media tool such as Act-On’s Advanced Social Media Module can also help you reach your customers by scheduling posts in advance, monitoring mentions, and helping you respond. You can even create advocacy boards to motivate staff to help spread the word about what you’re doing.\n\nAnd remember, the most successful demand generation tactics are less about promoting and more about giving your audience the information they need to make smart choices.\n\n\nH3: 5. Leverage account-based marketing\n\nGridlock. That’s what it feels like with an increasing number of decision-makers in the buying process, which slows down sales cycles. According to Gartner, the typical buying group for a B2B solution involves six to 10 decision-makers . A solution that helps you manage this growing challenge is account-based marketing (ABM).\n\nABM can help improve the odds of winning over multiple stakeholders. It complements demand generation by targeting high-value accounts to help optimize resources and personalize engagement.\n\nFor example, a salesperson can personalize messages and marketing to accounts, based on the combined needs and pain points of all stakeholders. ABM also helps nurture connections and supports upselling, to create even more potential opportunities.\n\n\nH3: 6. Use lead scoring\n\nThe purpose of lead gen is to attract new leads but also to make sure those leads are high quality. Lead scoring is a great way to do that.\n\nLead scoring evaluates a prospect’s past behavior — viewing web pages that signal purchase intent, interest in a product demo, and other actions. It uses this data to determine whether the lead is ready for the sales team. And if so, they can take action faster.\n\n\nH3: 7. Utilize marketing automation in your demand generation strategy\n\nAs you select the best demand-generation strategies, marketing automation can help support your efforts. The right tool can help you attract and nurture prospects throughout every stage in the funnel, from awareness to purchase.\n\nAs a result, you can shorten the sales cycle and more effectively link your efforts to specific results. Plus, as marketing teams struggle to do more with less, leveraging marketing automation helps you scale demand generation strategy while easing the burden on your staff.\n\nDo you need help attracting more prospects? If so, we can help! Download our eBook and we’ll give our favorite tips for attracting new high-quality leads.",

        "content": "Get off the hamster wheel of batch and blast emailing and start creating strategic nurtures that bring home the bacon\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: marketing pipelines]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Marketing-Segmentation-Pipeline-scaled.jpg\n\n\nLanding on a marketing strategy that’s effective in today’s oversaturated marketplace is, well, hard. The answer? Segmentation. Segmentation is all about specifically focusing on your target niches and creating personalized content resulting in optimization, retention, and deliverability worth bragging about.\n\nYou’ll want to pair those segmentation processes with a systematic and refined lead creation funnel – the two should create a harmonious relationship, be tied at the hip, and become best friends for life.\n\nSo, just how do we go about pairing these two together? Let’s start from the beginning …\n\nWhat is Behavioral Segmentation?\n\nIf you’re in the email marketing space, chances are you use segmentation strategies like demographic, geographic, or even psychographic fairly often as it can be a helpful tool for targeting your audience. While these types of segmentation techniques are helpful for maintaining a relationship with current customers and guiding prospects down the funnel, behavioral segmentation can significantly improve the customer and prospect experience overall. Essentially, behavioral segmentation analyzes user behavior (things like what emails they open, content they download, sites they visit on your Website) and then uses what you learn from those actions to accurately identify your audience’s actual needs to create personalized marketing strategies.\n\nIt’s simple— the more relevant and timely your emails are, the more likely you’ll get a positive reaction from your recipients. When you identify possible behavioral triggers, analyze your audience behavior, build your flows and create segments, it can be a sure fire way to drive engagement and achieve profitable outcomes.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Act-On aliens juggling data results]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sizelarge-Subjectchart.svg\n\n\nWhat Makes It Different?\n\nThere’s no denying that knowing your average customer’s gender, age, or lifestyle are important factors in addressing your audience’s needs. However, what sets behavioral segmentation apart from a segmentation like geographic is that while geographic segmentation uses traditional variables of customers, behavioral segmentation works off of customers’ actions. With this segmentation strategy specifically, you can continue to routinely collect sustainable data that will maximize value with your current customers and bring in more customers like them.\n\nBy being able to decipher how users are interacting with your email or product page, you as a marketer can make more informed decisions on how and where to best allocate time, budget, and resources. You can focus more on those that are actually likely to make a purchase rather than try and warm up predominantly cold leads.\n\nAdditionally, when you achieve regular engagement, it demonstrates that your audience finds value in your emails and that increases deliverability. Essentially, if your domain has a good reputation, it will signal to ISPs that your emails are relevant and beneficial to the recipient. Hence, landing them in their inbox. ISPs and Mailbox Providers ultimately decide where emails land and domain reputation is one of the key determinants of that. If you segment, understand, and keep your audience interested, you’ll find yourself with great inbox placement along with happy customers. A true win win.\n\nHow Do You Do It?\n\nUnder the umbrella of behavioral segmentation, there are several types you can test to succeed in identifying trends and patterns that will help predict which customers are most likely to make purchases. Customer engagement, habitual purchasing or brand interactions are among some of these types that can be effective in winning over prospects and strengthening current customer relationships.\n\nBy using marketing automation platforms that specialize in getting real time insights that can power behavioral segmentation efforts, you can use these analytics to correctly classify a user’s behavior and find  the perfect strategy to best personalize for your customers.\n\nIn Act-On’s platform, you can create these segments that help you identify and group contacts by their interactions with your marketing content. You set up these segments by locating contacts with specific response behaviors, selecting the time period in which the specified behaviors transpire, the behavior in which you want to define and then lastly, the frequency in which these behaviors are occurring.\n\nBy making these segments, marketers can have a better idea about what product or service might appeal to that particular person’s tastes which makes promoting products more effective by understanding target consumers’ behavior patterns. Even if this doesn’t lead to a homerun conversion every single time, the data you can acquire on where people go (and why) can provide an opportunity for targeted advertising on prospects in the future.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A pull-down menu in Act-On shows options for filtering messages by opened, was sent, clicked on, etc.]\nSource: https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mbIMezXJY63yI-m1UOvlE0gtl8X3knEl76YFL_F5mXykhrrETtCHPe4GN43xy0_2KeML49fQjCEjApu2i36r0x6W_4-7tdNmQus56oRpgJuKc6pmdOTIL543YjvChhn7QHE_Z0zD-3En7Xs5I0eO13ILLiGFnis0nV4kiApfE4fyF_64iWX3TNeL7ICcFg\n\n\nWhat it comes down to is when you streamline your marketing approach by implementing behavioral segmentation, you’ll undoubtedly give your audience exactly the content they’re looking for, incentivizing them to be a lifetime customer. The more specific you can be, the more you’ll be seen as favorable in the eyes of mailbox providers which will consequently result in happy customers.\n\nWhile behavioral segmentation is one crucial part of conversion optimization, you can take it to the next level by constructing a funnel based on behavioral segments. While ordinary funnel reports are successful in finding low-hanging fruit, with combining the powers of these two strategies, you can spot the inadequate first touchpoints, track the efficiency of your content and make the improvements you need to succeed. Here’s how.\n\nWhat is a Lead Creation Funnel and Why You Need One!\n\nIf you were to surmise one key takeaway from our section on behavioral segmentation, it’s undoubtedly the fact that there is no “one size fits all” approach to marketing today. However, there is one thing (typically two) that all marketers are in search of: eyeballs. Grabbing the attention of your target audience is no easy task, but it is imperative that you do so if you are to create a successful lead creation funnel.\n\nIn short, a lead creation funnel is the process by which you are attracting, nurturing and converting contacts into leads for your business. As you plan your lead creation funnel will flow, consider the following points to be instrumental to that process:\n\n- Identifying your target is key and should be clearly defined\n\n- Spot a problem and provide a solution\n\n- Accessible, engaging content (CTAs) coupled with email deliverability best practices\n\nEvery great idea should be coupled with an equally great plan. As it relates to your lead creation process, your plan should be to attract, interact, and convert your leads into customers.\n\nThe Process\n\nTOFU\n\nYour lead creation funnel should be aligned with your overarching lead acquisition and sales development programs. In order for that to occur, you will want to implement a process that helps enrich those programs.\n\nThis starts with the top of the funnel, or, TOFU. This portion of the funnel is designed to garner awareness and interest, utilizing different means such as:\n\n- Social Media\n\n- Email Outreach\n\n- Targeted landing pages\n\n- SEO/Pay-per-click ads\n\nOnce you have attracted your new leads, it is time to nurture them.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Act-On alien hugging and nurturing a heart]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sizelarge-Subjectempty-favorites.svg\n\n\nMOFU\n\nMOFU, or Middle of the Funnel, is where we get a bit more targeted, with specific nurture programs that automate based off of the interest we gathered at the Top of the Funnel. As your audience begins to become more refined, it will give you the opportunity to customize their journey based on their intent, with the goal of driving them to landing pages and obtaining contact information.\n\nThis stage is also paramount in ensuring that you are receiving favorable inboxing with your MOFU email campaigns. By sending to recently opted-in contacts, with content that they have signed up for and at a frequency that they are expecting, you are putting yourself in a great position to consistently reach the inbox.\n\nUltimately, anyone that has made it to the Middle of your Funnel is still weighing their purchasing options. In this stage, we want to capitalize on that opportunity and prove to them that your solution is the best fit for their specific wants or needs.\n\nBOFU\n\nIt’s now time for the conversion phase, also known as the Bottom of the Funnel (BOFU). When someone reaches this stage, they become a qualified lead and are ready to buy. This is the natural conclusion to your lead creation funnel.\n\nHowever, the work here is not yet done, as we still need to optimize these conversions. To do this, we will want to provide content such as free shipping, discount codes, or even additional products or services to help sweeten the pot. For B2B audiences, this could be things like free trials or assessments. This offer should be so irresistible that there is no way your lead could ever say no!\n\nFinal Word\n\nMake no mistake about it, the way in which you mesh your lead funnel and behavioral segmentation strategies will be vital to your success in generating new leads and returning positive ROI. It can’t be understated how important these structures are to bridge the gap between your marketing and sales teams.\n\nDeveloping smart and effective behavioral segmentation and lead funnel creation processes takes time, focus and brainpower. But isn’t it time you got off the hamster wheel of batch and blast emailing and started doing strategic nurturing to your customers and prospects that makes a real impact to your sales and marketing team? The answer is a resounding yes!",

We’ll cover topics like defining a target audience, setting shared metrics and definitions, and buttoning up technology and processes.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Two professionals high five with an abstract background, illustrating how to align sales and marketing.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingalignment3-1024x439.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: How to align sales and marketing on ideal customer profiles and buyer personas\n\nIf you don’t already have a well-documented ideal customer profile (ICP) and easily accessible buyer personas, then your sales and marketing teams could be on radically different pages about who you’re all actually trying to reach. (And if you do have them, consider revisiting them on a regular basis to address and changes in strategy—and to keep them top-of-mind for all teams.)\n\n\nH3: Develop your ICP\n\nYour ICP describes the firmographic details of the type of company you agree would be the best fit for your product or service. Industry, size, revenue—these are all quantitative data points that can inform your ICP. Align marketing and sales on your ICP to deliver a shared understanding of what kinds of leads you want to prioritize. Startups or enterprise orgs? Financial services or SaaS companies?\n\nDeveloping and documenting your ICP doesn’t mean you’ll only sell to or target one type of customer. But it helps every team prioritize their work and their budgets, and get better at their jobs.\n\n- BDRs can better prioritize their time when prospecting or conducting cold outreach.\n\n- Demand gen marketers can strategically plan ad spend for targeted campaigns.\n\n- Content marketers can determine what kinds of case studies resonate, and produce more of them.\n\n- SDRs can become more adept and efficient in qualifying conversations.\n\nWith an ICP in place, you know the kind of companies you want to target. Then, you can narrow in on the individuals within those organizations with buyer personas.\n\n\nH3: Buyer personas\n\nIf an ICP describes a company, a buyer persona describes an individual working at that company—your actual human buyer. And your sales and marketing team should consider your buyer personas their best imaginary friends.\n\nBuyer personas are fictional composites of your ideal customers, with details that make them feel real for your team. When done right, buyer personas are developed with market research, first hand experience, and customer listening—making them the ideal group project for marketing and sales teams. Marketers can provide industry research while salespeople can share insights from their daily conversations with actual buyers.\n\nBuyer personas usually include things like:\n\n- Fictionalized name and biography\n\n- Demographics (gender, location, job title, experience level, etc.)\n\n- Behavioral traits (including how they like to research and solve problems)\n\n- Interests (what they care about, both inside and outside of work)\n\n- Needs (what’s missing and what movitates them in their professional lives)\n\n- Pain points (what stresses them out, keeps them up at night or gives them a headache every morning)\n\nMost organizations have multiple personas, especially for products where purchasing decisions are shared among a team or committee. For example, you may have an executive decision-maker and an individual product user at the same company with significantly different motivators and pain points.\n\nSales and marketing teams can use buyer personas to tailor content, conversations, and overall messaging. When a blog post or piece of sales collateral is crafted with a specific buyer persona in mind, it should make your buyer feel as though you understand them, you know their pain points, and you probably have the solution to their problem.\n\n\nH2: How to align sales and marketing on goals, metrics, and definitions\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: An asian woman and man in business attire shake hands in an urban setting, illustrating how to align sales and marketing.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingalignment4-1024x576.jpg\n\n\nEven if marketing and sales teams are perfectly aligned on their ICP and buyer personas, that doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing throughout the buying journey. Everyone needs to be speaking the same language and tracking the same metrics as leads are generated, nurtured, and progressed throughout the shared marketing sales funnel.\n\n\nH3: Define MQLs and SQLs together\n\nIn most B2B companies, sales and marketing teams measure success not just by how many deals they close or new customers they acquire, but by the number of MQLs (marketing qualified leads), SALs (sales accepted leads) and/or SQLs (sales qualified leads) they generate each month or quarter.\n\nRevenue goals—and often individual bonuses —depend on outcomes like:\n\n- Demand gen marketers generating a minimum number of MQLs\n\n- Marketing teams handing off a certain amount of SQLs to the sales team\n\n- SDRs following up with SALs within a certain timeframe\n\nBut often, sales and marketing teams don’t have a shared understanding of what constitutes an MQL, SAL, or SQL in the first place. So when overall revenue targets are missed, it becomes a hot topic of debate about who dropped the ball. That’s when you hear accusations about marketing handing off too few (or too many low-quality) leads, or sales failing to follow up on the leads generated by marketing.\n\nBlame gets assigned, but without a shared vocabulary, actually solving problems and improving performance is nearly impossible. So it’s imperative for sales and marketing teams to get in the same room, get granular, and nail down what defines a lead at every stage of the funnel.\n\nTo give you a head start, here’s the functional overview of each type of lead—and how they can be defined in detail:\n\n\nH4: Marketing qualified leads (MQLs)\n\nMQLs are leads that the marketing team considers worthy of attention. You need to gather some specific level of information to assign this status, and this is where you can get down to brass tacks with sales: is first name and email enough to constitute an MQL? Or do you need the company name? What about company size? Do you want to exclude leads based on undesirable attributes, like belonging to an industry far outside your ICP, or using a @hotmail.com email?\n\n\nH4: Sales accepted leads (SALs)\n\nSALs are sales accepted leads, or MQLs that the sales team has received from marketing and considers warm and relevant enough to spend time on. Get agreement on what that means: Has an SDR initiated a conversation? Confirmed the lead is actually employed at a relevant company? Do they need to be in a specific role to be considered an SAL?\n\nFinally, SQLs are leads that have been thoroughly vetted by the sales team and everyone agrees they have a good chance of becoming a customer. Again, define what this means: maybe they’ve had a 1:1 conversation with an SDR. Maybe their role, company size, and current buying intentions have been confirmed over email.\n\nOne caveat here: not every company includes SALs in their processes, and that’s fine. If your organization wants to go directly to SQLs, it doesn’t really matter. The whole point is that everyone agrees on what threshold a lead needs to meet in order to progress to the next stage.\n\nWhen marketing and sales teams agree on these granular definitions, it helps everyone avoid wasting time on leads that aren’t likely to become customers. It helps your marketing team know what information to prioritize on dynamic forms , and build effective progressive profiling . It makes reporting much easier. And it removes excuses for failing to follow up on good leads.\n\n\nH2: Sales and Marketing in Action: Progressive Profiling\n\nProgressive profiling allows full-service agency The Marketing Guys to prioritize and capture the most relevant information about leads during webinar registrations. Marketers use that data to refine future engagement and the sales team has visibility to tailor conversations.\n\nOf course, the quality of a lead isn’t just based around what company they work for or what their title is. To really improve your lead quality, you need to look at behavioral signals that indicate how interested they are in buying your product—so you know when to nurture, when to have a conversation, and how to keep the buyer moving in the right direction.\n\nEnter lead scoring.\n\n\nH3: How to use lead scoring to align sales and marketing\n\nThere’s no single, uniform point when a lead is ready to go from marketing to sales. It all depends on your buying journey, the complexity of your product, the number of people involved in decision-making, and the preferences of your audience. Plus, that “hand-off” to sales might be more of a back-and-forth along the course of today’s non-linear buying journey.\n\nThat’s where lead scoring can be immensely useful to keep sales and marketing teams aligned—and to automate a time-consuming process.\n\nLead scoring is a quantitative framework you can use to rank and prioritize leads based on their actions and characteristics. Demographics like job title and company size, as well as behaviors like visiting certain webpages or downloading specific content, are assigned points—based on a hierarchy the sales and marketing team develop together.\n\nFor example, if a prospect checks out your pricing page, that’s a good sign they’re interested in buying your product—and it warrants a high score. But if another lead visits your careers page, that means they may be more likely to apply for a job than buy your product—so they might receive a low or even negative score.\n\nYour sales and marketing team should sit down together and develop the prioritization and scoring of all the different kinds of behaviors prospects can take. Then, you can determine what the total score would be to prompt a movement from lead to MQL, then MQL to SAL. You might decide that certain behaviors, like requesting a demo or starting a free trial, should catapult a lead directly into SAL territory. Over time, smaller indicators like reading case studies, attending webinars, and downloading a comparison guide could add up together to move a lead to the next stage of their buyer’s journey.\n\nAgain, there’s no clear-cut answer on when a lead is ready to move from nurture campaigns to one-on-one conversations. That’s only for your sales and marketing team to decide—together.\n\n\nH2: Sales and Marketing in Action: Lead Scoring\n\nThe sales and marketing teams at cloud services provider interworks.cloud automatically score lead behaviors along the customer lifecycle. Marketers use lead scoring to segment and nurture prospects, and then escalate leads to SQL status once a certain threshold is met—triggering a notification to the sales team within their Microsoft Dynamics CRM.\n\nOnce your lead definitions and scoring system are agreed-upon and documented, it’s time to put them into practice. And for most teams, that means integrating your technology .",

        "content": "Budget cuts, doing more with less, and consolidation of business tools are all on the rise in 2024. Jeff Coleman , chief customer officer at Act-On, explained during an interview that, as the economy contracts, customers are deciding to use fewer products and consolidate the ones they already have. And that leaves many battling to protect at-risk business.\n\nResearch shows that only two-fifths of companies focus equally on customer acquisition and retention, despite customer churn costing U.S. providers $168 million annually. The challenge is that even if you’re focusing on retention, cross-sells, and upsells, doing these tasks well isn’t always easy, and the job begins the moment the customer transitions from prospect to customer.\n\nJeff explained that the hunting and farming analogy is a common way to illustrate the difference between acquiring new customers (hunting) and retaining existing ones (farming). However, he thinks of it more like fishing at a friend’s lake.\n\n“If I show up at your dock and you let me fish in your lake, you’re being nice, right?” asks Jeff. “But if I leave my litter, overfish, and behave badly, you won’t let me fish there anymore.”\n\nIn other words, this bad situation happens when customers aren’t getting what they need after the initial sale (when we visit their ‘lake’). As we cultivate stronger relationships with our customers, we can deploy strategies from the onset that help build a foundation for reduced customer attrition and improve future growth.\n\n\nH2: Two Types of Growth\n\nNot all growth opportunities are created equally, with some being significantly easier to land. Jeff breaks opportunities into a couple of categories, which are:\n\n\nH3: Adoption-Led Growth\n\nWith adoption-led growth, you’re capturing opportunities that exist due to a natural evolution of business. “If your company uses Slack and hires five more people, you probably need five more licenses,” says Jeff. “Or if you have 1,000 employees using software and only have 700 licenses, it’s time to sell the additional licenses. These are the easiest opportunities to land.”\n\nCapturing the “low-hanging fruit” is important, but you also want to master the more challenging opportunities, which require more complex strategies and time to execute.\n\n\nH3: Sales Expansion Growth\n\nSales expansion growth, which includes your cross-sells and upsells, is trickier than adoption-led growth. The challenge is that a “post-sale” isn’t like a traditional sale, yet you can’t approach it with a service-only mindset either. Expansion requires strategic planning to protect your existing business.\n\n“Salesforce is an interesting example of this, where the salesperson is responsible for a loss up to a certain point,” says Jeff. “You can’t sell something new if it causes churn on the other side. You don’t get to count the increase unless you count the decrease.”\n\nBefore expanding, the key is to get the customer to use fully what they’ve already purchased. According to Jeff, most expansion is built on successfully deploying what the customer purchased the first time. In other words, it’s hard for a customer to justify buying more when they haven’t fully realized the value of what they already have.\n\nJennifer Blanco , director of customer marketing at Act-On, explains that when marketing to existing customers, an inverted pyramid is used.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Putting a stop to customer attrition is priority one for customer marketers. Learn how to engage customers from our experts.]\nSource: https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/6zVkzUHAxfjm4MHI3NHS8P2USfaU3MlMxZaCoiWM5lzgXdUIJnk294Mn3CNsr5LJOOvuN5HtXtelCD-ZujDDMXTIGC43e8_CZz2Ymb2OaDv_2i0HD1geahQtgZPDdKHMUh4MW_PWHsiP00oEx_SPsSQ\n\n\n“The first hurdle the new customer needs to get over is onboarding, and the second is adopting your solution,” says Jennifer. “A great onboarding and adoption are the overall key to success, but not nearly enough companies put enough emphasis on these areas.”\n\nWhen considering customer growth and retention, an important distinction is customer satisfaction versus customer loyalty .\n\nIn a recent McKinsey & Company study, customer care was cited among the top three priorities for participants. And despite companies working really hard at customer care and service, Jeff suggests that you can’t differentiate yourself on service alone. He explains that you need to get people to use your product successfully. It needs to be embedded in the infrastructure of what they do.\n\n“I read this book about net promoter scores, and it talked about loyalty,” says Jeff. “It said, ‘How many times have you heard someone say, Yeah, I like that steakhouse, but if there’s a new one in town, I’m totally going to try it?’ There is a difference between satisfaction and loyalty.”\n\nBuilding loyalty is one of the reasons why investing in a strong onboarding process is critical when it comes to getting embedded into customer workflows and helping them experience the full product value faster.\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH2: Customer Attrition and Building a Stronger Foundation\n\nBuilding a stronger foundation and reducing customer attrition start with your welcome series, according to Jennifer. She shares that, at Act-On, we break this into a couple of initial nurturing sequences:\n\n1. The new welcome nurture sequence. We give our customers the lay of the land and tell them what to expect during the onboarding process.\n\n2. The brand-new user welcome series. This nurture campaign is designed for users who have never used Act-On before. It has a few touchpoints focused on what to expect and beginner resources.\n\n“I’ve found it’s amazing how many customers aren’t doing the basic things to get off to a great start,” says Jennifer. “We know that onboarding tasks are critical to our customers’ success, so it’s also critical to our success, right? The purpose of the nurtures is to make sure customers have the basics checked off their lists.”\n\nMarketing automation is helpful for setting up these experiences with customers, but Jennifer highlights the importance of combining automation with a human touch.\n\n“I’m constantly asking our customer-facing teams, ‘Hey, what have you heard from our clients lately?’” says Jennifer. “I want to find out which of our customers have recently had successes so we can celebrate with them and send them a gift or something special.”\n\nThis cross-functional balance is an important part of success. It improves the experience and builds stronger relationships to prevent churn and build loyalty.\n\n\nH2: Churn Reduction and Rethinking Measurement\n\nCustomer marketing isn’t always straightforward to measure, mostly because there isn’t a single variable to track and calculate. When Jennifer measures success, she often looks at the overall impact:\n\nHow many customers participated in the program?\n\nHow many have upgraded to this specific feature?\n\nWhat was the revenue impact of all of that?\n\nFor example, we recently relaunched a customer success program that involved transforming a basic customer webinar series into landing pages, office hours, and hands-on workshops.\n\nDuring the first year, 286 accounts attended, and that attendance grew to 400 the following year – a 140% increase. Participants who attended had a 24% increase in retention.\n\nSo, remember: it’s a long game.\n\n“If you can retain and grow your customer base, you’re going to continue to see your revenue go up,” says Jennifer. “But if you can’t keep and grow your existing customers, you’ll always be playing catch-up.”\n\nLooking at existing strategies for churn management and customer relationship expansion can help prepare for stronger growth, because you won’t be fighting an uphill battle created by lost business.\n\nDo you need help developing a stronger strategy to reduce customer attrition, reduce churn, and improve cross-sells and upsells?

But even if you’ve carefully designed your ideal customer profiles, you can still go deeper in your targeting, helping your prospects feel known, understood, and aligned with your products and services. How? The answer is: audience segmentation.\n\nIt’s a complicated process, but understanding the concept, what it is, why you do it, and having a great example (we’re sharing our favorite!) can set you on the right path.\n\n\nH2: What is audience segmentation?\n\nAudience segmentation is the process of dividing a large group of prospects or customers into smaller segments to provide more relevant messaging and communication to each segment. When you segment strategically, you can better persuade prospective buyers using the topics that are most relevant to them. For example, let’s say your company sells project management tools. Your prospects may have many interests, such as task organization, team collaboration, or budget management. As a result, you could use audience segmentation to group people based on their specific interests.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A businessman walks down a well lit corridor with a briefcase, in black and white accented by rainbow lines, illustrating the idea of audience segmentation]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/automated-customer-segmentation-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Why is audience segmentation important?\n\nAudience segmentation is important because it helps improve marketing results.\n\nResearch shows that organizations using segmentation report earning 10% to 20% more in revenue and increasing their conversions by up to 50%. That’s not bad, right?\n\nAnd logically, it makes sense. If you’re interested in cooking, you might open an email about cooking. But if you’re interested in the subtopic of barbeque recipes, you’re probably much more likely to hit open. Why? It’s more personalized to what you need. And because of this personalization, you’ll capture the advantage of more effectively persuading buyers.\n\nAs a result, when your competitors push out generalized messages, you’re getting cozy with prospects under their noses by zeroing in on their specific needs and interests. And who do you think they’ll consider more seriously when shopping for a new solution? That’s right, you!\n\n\nH2: Types of Audience Segmentation\n\nAs you consider audience segmentation, you can approach it in many different ways. You might decide to segment based on demographics, such as job title. Or you might decide to target based on interest or stage in the buyer’s journey (a couple of our favorites, by the way). Here are a few potential options:\n\nDemographics. With demographics, you group by common audience attributes, such as age, job title, geography, education level, and more.\n\nIndustry. You can also segment based on detailed information about a company, such as annual revenue, organization size, growth rate, and more, aligning with your ideal customer profile (ICP) or target market.\n\nBehavioral elements. As your audience engages with your content, you track their behaviors. A marketing automation segmentation tool is great for this task. Examples include website activity and purchase behavior, allowing you to determine your audience’s needs.\n\nInterests. A prospect might read a blog post on lead generation, attend a webinar, and read an eBook on the same topic. These touchpoints signal a strong audience interest in lead generation, so you can use that data to segment the audience .\n\nBuyer’s journey. Every prospect interacting with your brand is at a specific stage in their buyer’s journey, which typically includes awareness, consideration, and decision. We can segment them based on their place in the journey to provide personalized communication and content.\n\nFor example, a prospect in the awareness stage might enjoy helpful tips for solving their problem. A person later in their journey, such as consideration, might enjoy a guide about evaluating solutions. During the decision stage, that prospect might enjoy a webinar or demo about how to use your specific product.\n\nHere at Act-On, we experiment quite a bit with automated segmentation . In the past, we’ve used ICPs, but more recently, we decided to switch things up and segment based on interests and the buyer’s journey stage. The difference in results was significant. Tip: Do you already have Act-On and want to see how to build a segment? Here’s a complete walk-through .\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A young woman holding a laptop speaks on a cellphone in black and white with rainbow colored bands, illustrating the concept of audience segmentation]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/automated-customer-segmentation-2-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: A real example of segmentation\n\nReady for a real example? Last year, we experimented with our lead nurturing programs. With these programs, our audience might consume content (like you’re doing now), download a helpful resource, and enter a lead nurturing series where we continue to provide value.\n\nOur internal expert, Kesley Yen, decided to take a fresh look at these programs and see whether we could get even more personalized. While in the past we segmented the audience based on ICPs, she decided to segment based on interest and stage in the buyer’s journey .\n\nAfter only six months, the results were excellent.\n\nWith the previous program, we averaged a 25% open rate in our programs. The click-through rate was 1.3%, and we had a 1.4% opt-out rate. With the new program, the open rate jumped to 48%, the click-through rate increased to 17.9%, and the opt-out rate was roughly 1.2%.\n\nSo, yes, aligning with your ICPs is a great start. But the more personalized you can get, the better. That’s why it’s helpful to use audience segmentation based on factors like interest and stage of the journey to get even more specific in the needs you’re serving and build stronger, more meaningful relationships.\n\n\nH3: Get Proactive With Lead Nurturing: Boost Efforts With Intent\n\n\nH2: Good marketing starts with great audience segmentation\n\nUntil we teach AI to buy products, your audience will continue to be human, with human interests and human behaviors. They will do what serves them best. And when you make your interactions more valuable through audience segmentation and personalization, you align with those ‘best interests.’\n\nYour audience will be more likely to want to hear from you, read your content, and eventually become customers. And because of the synergy you’ve created with audience segmentation, you’ll have far less friction along the way.\n\nSo, remember:\n\n1. Decide how you’ll segment your audience (demographics, industry, behavior, interests, buyer’s journey, etc.).\n\n2. Segment them into appropriate groups.\n\n3. Create content, experiences, and interactions that meet their needs in order to nurture stronger relationships.\n\nAnd if you need help learning how to gather data to segment and nurture more effectively, we’ve got you covered with an on-demand webinar that covers all the important details.\n\n\nH3: Get Proactive With Lead Nurturing: Boost Efforts With Intent",

        "content": "Winning new customers is an exciting accomplishment. But most marketers also know the real work begins after that.\n\nThe cost of acquiring a new customer is estimated to be five to seven times more than retaining an existing one. Retention issues translate to lost dollars and more work for marketing teams who strive to battle the vicious cycle of churn.\n\nMultichannel marketing is frequently used for new customer acquisition but is often overlooked as a strategy to increase customer retention. So, if you’re looking to boost retention efforts, cross-sells, and upsells, we’ve shared our favorite multichannel marketing customer retention strategies to jump-start your efforts.\n\n\nH2: Why Use Multichannel Marketing with Your Existing Customers?\n\nImagine that your customer makes a purchase. They’re excited, and they love your product, but the novelty wears off over time. They get bored, and all those shiny new features lose their appeal.\n\nIn the meantime, your team has launched brand-new product features. But the customer has no idea, and eventually, they go shopping, find a competitor’s product, and make a switch.\n\nBummer, right?\n\nUsing customer retention tactics, such as multichannel marketing, helps keep your existing customers engaged. That engagement affirms your product’s value and provides opportunities to cross-sell and upsell.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: a businessperson with a briefcase reviews multichannel marketing content on a mobile device to illustrate increasing customer retention]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/increase-customer-retention-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: How to Increase Customer Retention: 4 Strategies\n\nAs with any marketing effort, your starting point should always be the customer . Talk with your sales and marketing teams and gather intel.\n\nWhere do your customers struggle?\n\nWhat questions do they have?\n\nWhat are their most pressing goals and reasons for purchasing your product?\n\nTo increase customer retention, you’ll want to understand these needs and map relevant content and resources to touchpoints along their journey. Here are four areas to try.\n\n\nH3: 1. Email nurturing\n\nDuring 2023, we had an interesting challenge. Our nurture sequence emails were doing reasonably well, but we knew they could do better. Our internal guru, Kelsey Yen, took up the challenge.\n\nShe inventoried the current programs and worked to match them more closely with people’s intents and journeys. Open rates jumped from 25% to 48%, and click-through rates increased from 1% to nearly 18%.You can read the step-by-step guide here .\n\nWhile Kelsey was working to improve new prospect nurture sequences, you could easily apply a similar strategy with your existing customers. Here’s what that might look like:\n\n- Send a welcome email to new customers.\n\n- Ask about their most pressing interests and goals, and then segment them in your marketing automation program.\n\n- Funnel customers into a nurture sequence, delivering specific content and resources based on their interests to reinforce the value and increase customer retention.\n\nMeasure your open rates, click-through rates, and engagement to continue testing and refining new content and focusing on areas with positive metrics. For example, if you learn new customers interested in email marketing are also interested in deliverability, you can continue adding more training and resources to that nurture sequence.\n\n\nH3: 2. Social media\n\nRemember when you talked with sales and customer service and mapped out customer interests and needs? You’ll want to continue using that information.\n\nImagine that you sell marketing automation. You learn that your new customers struggle with deliverability issues after the new Yahoo and Google changes , so you decide to create content to help and reinforce your value.\n\nYou might create a webinar on the topic featuring your internal experts (more on webinars shortly). Then, you can cut that content into mini lessons and share it on social media.\n\nBy the way, you are asking customers to join you on social media, right? Identify one or two channels where they hang out, and then make the ask during your welcome email. And don’t just ask; give them a sample of some awesome content you’ve produced on the channel recently so they can see the benefit of joining you.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: a triumphant business person celebrating increasing customer retention]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/retention-marketing-2-1024x683.jpg\n\n\n\nH3: 3. Training and tutorials on landing pages\n\nIn 2022, we relaunched our Power-Up webinars , a series created specifically for our existing customers. The goals are to help them solve their challenges and understand how to get the most from their marketing automation, and grow the relationship .\n\nIn the first year of the relaunch, we delivered value to 286 accounts. The following year, that number grew to 400 accounts, representing a 140% increase. What’s more, those who attended experienced a 24% increase in retention rate.\n\nHere’s what we do:\n\n1. Find topics our customers need help with. We look at webinars that have done well in the past, as well as feedback we’re getting on an ongoing basis.\n\n2. Create and deliver the webinar. We also have “office hours” to give our customers more guidance in a smaller group setting.\n\n3. Post the webinar on a landing page, with related content to help our customers deepen their knowledge.\n\nOur focus is on helping our customers be as successful as possible in accomplishing their goals, which naturally increases customer retention.\n\n\nH3: 4. Website content with customer stories\n\nMost marketers create customer success stories to help new prospects understand how an existing customer solves their problem using the product. However, many don’t create stories for their existing customers .\n\nTalk with your sales team to learn which customers have experienced impressive success by using additional products, such as cross-sells or upsells. Then, record a video or written case study, repurpose that content into the relevant lead-nurturing series, share clips on social media, and post it to your website.\n\n\nH2: How to Improve Customer Retention by Starting Small\n\nTake one action. Revamp your welcome series , plan a webinar, or publish an upsell customer success story. Then, test another, and another, until you have a reservoir of data to draw from. Find out where you’re getting the most success, and then double down to scale your results.\n\nAnd of course, an important tool in scaling is marketing automation. It’s also useful for gaining insights into customer interests and needs. Check out our Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention guide and we’ll give you the playbook on harnessing that data.",

        "content": "Technology can’t solve every problem between sales and marketing. But once you get aligned on the principles , sales and marketing software integrations can bring shared processes to life much easier.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Two team members, pictured from the shoulders down, sit in front of a laptop collaborate on sales and marketing software]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingtechnology1-1024x634.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Integrating your CRM and MAP\n\nSales teams live and die by their CRM. And marketing teams depend on a solid marketing automation platform (MAP) to deliver personalized content at scale. When the two platforms work together, magic happens. (And by magic, we mean smooth handoffs.)\n\nA solid CRM – MAP integration requires two-way communication. You need a bidirectional integration to support full visibility into how a prospect interacts with marketing content and sales team members throughout their journey. Data has to pass in both directions, with no manual labor or spreadsheet uploads required.\n\nThe sales team should be able to see how a potential customer has engaged with content in the past. Knowing what case studies they’ve read, which webinars they’ve attended, and what emails they tend to open will give them valuable insight into what matters most to this particular lead. They can structure their conversations and follow-up based on this intel. And real-time alerts keep salespeople informed of how their leads are engaging with the website, emails, and content as their conversations progress.\n\nSimilarly, the marketing team should be able to see common CRM data like company size and deal status—because leads don’t stop engaging with marketing content once a sales conversation happens. Visibility into CRM data will help marketers segment and personalize content, such as delivering emails from their assigned sales rep.\n\nSome teams believe an all-in-one, mega-platform that provides both marketing automation and CRM capabilities is the easiest way to achieve this kind of visibility. But most sales and marketing experts agree that usually leads to one team compromising on what they need. That only increases tension, not alignment.\n\nInstead, marketing teams should find a MAP they love and sales teams should find the CRM that best meets their needs—including a robust, two-way integration.\n\n\nH2: Sales and Marketing Alignment in Action: Tech Integration\n\nAt manufacturing brand BinMaster, marketers use a native integration between their MAP and their Dynamics CRM to orchestrate automated email campaigns for new prospects—complete with dynamic insertion of the relevant salesperson’s photo, name, and contact info.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A closeup of an ipad displaying sales and marketing software analytics as several colleagues look on.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingtechnology2-1024x749.jpg\n\n\n\nH3: Define “handback” processes and develop workflows\n\nDefining MQLs, SALs, and SQLs, and implementing lead scoring, helps teams know when to hand off qualified leads from marketing to sales. But given the complexity of modern buying journeys, you also need to be prepared for leads to be “rejected” by sales and come back to marketing.\n\nMaybe a lead was given a setback by their buying committee, or simply wants to do more research on their own before talking with sales. Those leads shouldn’t be cast aside, but returned to marketing for ongoing engagement. When their circumstances change, they can find their way back through the funnel and, hopefully, reconnect with sales at the right time.\n\nMake sure the right fields are available in your CRM to capture information from sales when this happens, and that the right workflows are set up in your MAP to re-engage those returned leads. Include a path for sharing feedback from sales to marketing, and a way for marketing to collect and analyze that feedback—hopefully improving the qualification and handoff process over time.\n\n\nH2: Build relationships—and empathy\n\nFinally, marketing and sales teams need to spend some good old-fashioned time together and build some empathy. It’s good for the business, and it will make both teams better at their jobs.\n\nIdeally, this starts at the top. When Udi Ledergor was CMO at Gong, he had a memorable take on how to predict his peers’ likelihood of success: whether or not they knew how their CRO took their coffee . His thesis was that sales and marketing leaders who spent time together and knew each other outside of executive meetings would build the rapport and trust needed to function as teammates, not adversaries.\n\nAnd even if weekly coffee dates within the C-suite aren’t a possibility, team members at every level of the organization can make an effort to build relationships across the sales and marketing divide.\n\nThere is so much that each team can learn from one another. The sales team has daily conversations with would-be customers, and keeps their finger on the pulse of what messaging is resonating and what’s missing. The marketing team has a bigger-picture perspective on the industry as a whole, and keeps up with the latest research and trends that can help sales frame their conversations in a richer context.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: In a dark office, coworkers collaborate on sales and marketing software at a cluttered conference table.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingtechnology3-1024x683.jpg\n\n\nBut we get it—making friends can be awkward. So here are a few questions we’ve found can spark great conversations:\n\n- What slide in your presentation deck gives the buyer their “lightbulb moment”?\n\n- Which ones do you skip over, because they never seem to resonate?\n\n- What statistic always seems to catch your prospect’s attention?\n\n- What case study is your favorite to share? Why?\n\n- Which roles do you love to talk to most? Why?\n\n- What factor really seals the deal for prospects?\n\n- If you could wave a magic wand and have your leads understand one thing about our product, what would it be?\n\nGet lunch (in-person or virtual). Listen in on calls. Ask for feedback after new products or features go to market. Work with leadership to create formal opportunities to collaborate, such as annual or quarterly kickoffs (remote, hybrid, or otherwise).\n\nYou’ll get inspired, and your sales team will have a better understanding of how marketing is working their butts off to support them.\n\n\nH2: Sales and marketing software alignment is worth the effort\n\nBottom line: Marketing and sales aren’t oil and water . They’re peanut butter and chocolate—both great on their own, but pure magic when they come together. Reaching alignment isn’t easy, but it’s absolutely worth it.",

        "content": "Now that we’ve covered the basics of lead scoring , let’s talk about building your own lead scoring model. Designing a lead scoring model seems like a complex proposition. And if you jump into it without a solid strategy in place, you aren’t going to see game-changing results (or a happy sales team). So let’s break it down. There are clear steps you need to take to build and implement a lead scoring model:\n\n\nH2: Assemble your cross-functional squad\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, lead scoring is a team sport. It’s only useful when all the relevant players are aligned, bought-in, and using the framework on a daily basis. So before you start assigning points and determining thresholds, recruit active participants to help develop your lead scoring framework from the ground up.\n\nIn addition to marketing and sales, Suzy Balk, our Sr. Marketing Campaigns Manager, advises that product teams should be included in lead scoring. “If you’re releasing new products or features, it’s important to know what those are because you want to pull in the people who will find them most valuable. So loop in Product, because they will have those insights.”\n\n\nH2: Know your persona\n\nFirst things first: make sure your sales, marketing, and other relevant teams (like product) are in agreement on what your ideal customer looks like. This means having well-documented and up-to-date ideal customer profiles (ICP) and buyer personas, which will be essential in step five.\n\n\nH4: Define your ICP\n\nThink of your ICP like the bullseye in the center of a dartboard. It’s the kind of company you’re going to aim for: the most likely size, industry, and location to benefit from (and buy) your product and services.\n\nYou won’t only sell to those kinds of companies — just like you’ll hit the segments surrounding the bullseye during a game of darts — but you’ll prioritize them in your lead scoring by assigning them the highest points.\n\n\nH4: Create your buyer personas\n\nYour buyer personas are imagined biographies based on firsthand experience, market research, and customer listening. They describe the individuals working at your ICP companies, and give sales and marketing teams a fictionalized human to target with messaging, content, and campaigns.\n\nThey also give you a target for lead scoring: you’ll assign points to prospects who most closely resemble your buyer personas when it comes to job title, location, experience level, and other demographic details.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Create a customer journey map\n\nJust as you need to know who you’re trying to reach, you need to know where they interact with your brand along their buying journey. Get everyone aligned with a clear customer journey map : a picture of the most important touch points they encounter and steps they take as they move from would-be lead to loyal customer.\n\nCustomer journey maps include steps like:\n\n- Downloading a comparison tool\n\n- Reading an ebook\n\n- Checking out a pricing page\n\n- Contacting the sales team or requesting a demo\n\n- Completing a purchase\n\n- Renewing a subscription\n\nThe most effective customer journey maps also represent the customer’s mindset or emotional state at each stage, highlighting potential pain points or concerns that marketers can address. These maps can be incredibly simple or very complex, with layers in a heavily matrixed spreadsheet, but having one in place will make assigning behavioral scores in step six much easier.\n\nPlus, companies that use customer journeys are twice as likely to outperform competitors that don’t, likely because it helps teams hone their messaging and content to answer specific needs and questions that arise during the buying process.\n\n\nH2: Set your lead score scale\n\nLet’s be real here: in a lead scoring model, the numbers are entirely made up. The whole framework hinges on the relative importance of each piece of information or behavior.\n\nYou’re trying to answer one question: How important is this factor in terms of indicating likelihood to purchase?\n\nSo before you start assigning points willy-nilly, get a reasonable scale in mind. Are you scoring each datapoint on a scale of 1-5? 1-100?\n\nIf you’re new to lead scoring, we suggest keeping it simple with a 1/5/10/15 scale:\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: 1/5/10/15 lead scoring scale\n\n1 point = unimportant or unlikely indicator of buying potential\n\n5 points = somewhat important or possible indicator of buying potential \n\n10 points = important or likely indicator of buying potential\n\n15 points = very important or highly meaningful indicator of buying potential]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AO_Lead-Scoring_Graphs_model-scale-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nKeep in mind, you’ll also be assigning negative lead scoring points (-1, -5, -10, etc.) to certain attributes or behaviors that indicate a prospect is highly unlikely to buy.\n\n\nH2: Assign demographic and firmographic scoring factors\n\nNow’s the time to put your ICP and buyer persona data into play. Assign your relative scores for the attributes that matter most to your business, such as:\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Firmographic factors to consider when scoring leads:\nIndustry\nCompany size (number of employees)\nCompany size (revenue)\nGeographic location\nComplementary technologies used (CRM, ERP, DAM, etc.)\nAnnual budget\nJob title\nYears of experience]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AO_Lead-Scoring_Graphs_Model-firmographics-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nRemember our two imaginary Act-On leads, Debbie (the marketing director) and Tyson (the small business owner)? Let’s score their hypothetical explicit data:\n\nDebbie, the Director of Marketing\n\n- Manufacturing industry: 10 points (this industry is undergoing a digital transformation, so we’re seeing a lot of interest from these companies right now)\n\n- 2000-person company: 10 points (pretty close to our ICP)\n\n- “Director of Marketing” title: 15 points (exactly matches up with our buyer personas)\n\nTyson, the small business owner\n\n- Restaurant industry: 1 point (not totally irrelevant, but not our ICP)\n\n- 1-person company: -15 points (solo entrepreneurs don’t usually have much budget for marketing software)\n\n- “Owner” title : 1 point (too general to tell us much about the individual, and not one of our buyer personas)\n\nMake your list of firmographic and demographic lead scoring factors as comprehensive as possible for your business, and remember — you can always come back and update your framework later. Do not let perfection get in the way of progress, especially if you’re just getting started.\n\n\nH2: Assign behavioral lead scoring factors\n\nThis is where, in our biased opinion, the lead scoring model really gets fun. By tracking behavior over time, you can assess how interested a lead is in your product, how far along they are in that buyer’s journey, and whether they’re ready to stop reading and start talking.\n\n“Most companies are going to have top-of-funnel content to establish themselves as thought leaders,” says Suzy. “A one-time download of that kind of content doesn’t mean anything from a sales-readiness perspective. If it happens, consistently, now that’s a different story — and that’s where lead scoring comes in.”\n\nPull out your customer journey map and start to assign points to the different behaviors you can track for your leads. Prioritize the steps that matter most for your business, and get specific about which behaviors show the strongest signal of interest in purchasing:\n\n- Events or webinars Registration: medium signal of interest\nAttendance: stronger signal (because showing up demonstrates a more serious interest than merely signing up)\n\n- Website visits Homepage: low signal\nAbout page: medium signal\nPricing page: stronger signal\nCareers page: negative signal (this person wants a job, not to buy your product)\n\n- Content downloads Introductory guide: low signal\nThought leadership or trends content: low signal \nStrategic how-to content (not product-specific): medium signal\nProduct comparison: strong signal\nProduct implementation guide: stronger signal\n\n- Traffic or referral sources Organic search (product-specific term): medium signal\nOrganic search (non-product term): low signal\nLinked from product review site: strong signal \nCustomer referral: strong signal\n\n- Social media interactions Post like: low signal\nPage follow: low signal\n\n- Tradeshow booth visits Scanning badge for a raffle entry: low signal\nEngaging in lengthy conversation: medium or strong signal, depending on the context\n\n- Demo requests This is usually a “go straight to sales” action, and should immediately surpass your MQL threshold (more on that in a moment).\n\n- Registration: medium signal of interest\n\n- Attendance: stronger signal (because showing up demonstrates a more serious interest than merely signing up)\n\n- Homepage: low signal\n\n- About page: medium signal\n\n- Pricing page: stronger signal\n\n- Careers page: negative signal (this person wants a job, not to buy your product)\n\n- Introductory guide: low signal\n\n- Thought leadership or trends content: low signal\n\n- Strategic how-to content (not product-specific): medium signal\n\n- Product comparison: strong signal\n\n- Product implementation guide: stronger signal\n\n- Organic search (product-specific term): medium signal\n\n- Organic search (non-product term): low signal\n\n- Linked from product review site: strong signal\n\n- Customer referral: strong signal\n\n- Post like: low signal\n\n- Page follow: low signal\n\n- Scanning badge for a raffle entry: low signal\n\n- Engaging in lengthy conversation: medium or strong signal, depending on the context\n\n- This is usually a “go straight to sales” action, and should immediately surpass your MQL threshold (more on that in a moment).\n\nLet’s look at another lead scoring example with Debbie and Tyson. Here’s how we would score their implicit data, respectively:\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Lead Scoring Example \nDebbie, Director of Marketing\nReferred by an affiliate: 5 points\n\nVisited our homepage: 1 point\n\nVisited our About page: 5 points\n\nDownloaded a bottom-of-funnel guide (how to implement marketing automation software): 15 points\n\nOpened a link within a nurture email: 5 points \n\nRegistered for a bottom-of-funnel webinar (comparing marketing automation providers): 25 points\n\nTyson the small business owner\n\nFound our site via organic search: 1 point\n\nDownloaded a top-of-funnel guide (intro to email marketing): 5 points]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AO_Lead-Scoring_Graphs_model-example-1024x768.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Don’t neglect negative lead scoring\n\nWe’ve mentioned negative lead scoring above, but it bears repeating: use negative points to keep unqualified leads out of your sales team’s workflows.\n\nHere are a few more examples of when to apply negative lead scores:\n\n\nH4: Job titles\n\nA “student” is probably not your buyer persona, and likely warrants a negative score. But an “intern” may be doing research for their employer, and shouldn’t be disqualified altogether.\n\n\nH4: Missing key data points\n\nIf a lead leaves important fields blank, like a phone number or company name, they likely aren’t ready for a conversation.\n\n\nH4: Email domains\n\nInstead of requiring a business email domain to download content, simply use negative scoring to de-prioritize leads who use personal or .edu emails. You can also de-prioritize leads from your existing customers’ email domains (they would be relevant for customer success, but not sales) or competitors’ domains (you can’t stop the spies from checking out your content, but you can make sure they don’t waste your sales team’s time).\n\n\nH4: Location\n\nIf you don’t provide your service or product to their location, they will never be your customer — so downgrade their lead score accordingly.\n\nNeed more ideas? Just ask your SDRs. They know what red flags to look for, and will be delighted to share their expertise.\n\n\nH2: Set your MQL threshold\n\nThis is it. The big moment. Time to set your threshold: how many points should a marketing lead accrue in your lead scoring model before they’re ready to hand over to sales?\n\nPro tip: make sure this decision is not made in a silo.\n\nTake a look at your assigned points and start doing math on your meeting room whiteboard or your favorite remote collaboration tool. Mock up some scenarios in your shared spreadsheet.\n\nGet sales and marketing to agree:\n\n- How many bottom-of-funnel content downloads?\n\n- How many email clicks?\n\n- Which industries?\n\n- What job titles?\n\n- When are these leads ready to talk to sales?\n\nOnce you have the answer, set your MQL threshold.\n\n\nH4: Adjust your direct-to-sales activities\n\nNow, go back and look at your behavioral lead scoring again. Some of these activities might be direct triggers to sales, such as requesting a demo or filling out a “contact us” form. Adjust that relative scoring to your MQL threshold to ensure every lead who raises their hand to talk to sales does exactly that.\n\n\nH4: Account for leads that return to marketing\n\nEven with the best lead scoring model in place, certain leads will be handed over to sales that aren’t quite ready to purchase. Maybe they’re highly interested in your product, but are under contract with a competitor for another year. Maybe they provided misleading information when filling out their forms, or don’t have the budget. And maybe they just never answer an email or phone call, going radio silent for no discernible reason.\n\nUnless the sales team disqualifies those leads, they are typically returned to marketing for continued nurturing. In that case, Suzy suggests implementing a “cooling off” period before a lead can be handed off to sales again. “For us, when you’re returned to marketing, you can’t return to sales for 120 days,” he says. Their lead-scoring slate is wiped clean, and they can’t reach MQL status until that time window is up — unless they fill out a demo form.\n\n\nH2: Evaluate, adjust, and repeat\n\nCongrats! Check the box and give yourself a cookie. You’re all done with lead scoring. Forever.\n\nJust kidding. Lead scoring is not a set-it-and-forget-it program. It’s an ongoing process — and that’s why it works so well.\n\n“The great thing about lead scoring is that it’s a model,” says Suzy. “So after you get some results in, you can always go back and make adjustments. You don’t have to — and shouldn’t be trying to — find the perfect model that will work forever.”\n\nContinue to work with your cross-functional lead scoring squad to monitor progress, track success, and refine your model over time.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH4: How to evaluate lead scoring metrics\n\nGet continual feedback from your sales team on how the lead scoring model is working — both qualitative and quantitative.\n\nTo gather qualitative input, have regular meetings, ask about specific channels and campaigns, and keep a conversation going between sales and marketing about what’s working and what’s not.\n\nTo measure quantitative success, build a disposition into your CRM that requires specific input from sales when they disqualify a lead. Suzy advises making this field a dropdown list of set options, rather than an open text field, to make analysis easier.\n\n“Maybe the company is too small, maybe the title wasn’t a good fit after all, or maybe they seemed like they weren’t a real person because the SDR couldn’t find them on LinkedIn,” says Suzy. “Here at Act-On, we have a definitive list of possible status reasons that we ask the sales team to use, and a notes field where we can capture additional data.”\n\nSuzy also suggests paying close attention to opportunity creation metrics. By tracking what factors are common across leads that are successfully turned into opportunities, you can identify what factors should be weighed more heavily in future lead scoring.\n\nFor example, if the data shows that a large percentage of your opportunities are created within a certain industry, you can go back and adjust your lead scoring to rate that industry highly. Suzy recommends evaluating job titles regularly, too.\n\n“It’s common for companies to prioritize VPs and the C-suite in their lead scoring,” says Suzy. “But I wouldn’t even call those roles ‘decision-makers’. More often than not, a manager or a director makes the call, and brings their decision to the C-suite for approval. So you might be scoring high on the VPs and C-suite, but they typically aren’t the ones who start, engage, and move the buying process forward. And you won’t know that’s the case unless you look at the opportunities and see where they’re being created.”\n\n\nH4: When to adjust lead scoring\n\nSuzy recommends a regular cadence for updating your lead scoring model—at least quarterly. “Look at your lead scoring regularly and make sure that you’re accounting for changes in the business, new products being released, or larger shifts like a recession.”\n\nLook forward to our next article in this series, where we’ll round up the best lead scoring tools to use in your marketing!",

        "content": "Now that we’ve covered the basics of lead scoring , and how to build your model , let’s tackle the last topic in our 3-part lead scoring series: lead scoring tools. Lead scoring is a process and a framework, not a tool — but technology makes it possible to implement at scale. Here are the lead scoring tools you can expect to use in your quantitative quest.\n\n\nH2: Lead scoring tools: lead enrichment\n\nLead enrichment tools like ZoomInfo supplement your first-party data (like form fills and website tracking) with third-party information.\n\nWhile you don’t need lead enrichment tools to implement lead scoring, they can make it easier to gather and populate your records with clean, verified data about your prospects’ demographics and firmographics. And the more data you have, the more effective your lead scoring will be.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A man in a server room holds a tablet while using lead scoring tools for marketing.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lead-scoring-tools-1-1024x683.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Lead scoring tools: Marketing automation\n\nUnlike lead enrichment, marketing automation tools are a must-have: your marketing automation platform is where your lead scoring actually happens.\n\nTo support advanced lead scoring, a robust marketing automation platform will:\n\n- Store and organize your contact data\n\n- Develop and deploy lead scoring models\n\n- Monitor and track lead engagement across your website, email, social media, and other channels\n\n- Automatically update lead scores based on behaviors or added datapoints\n\n- Sync contact and lead scoring data with your CRM so the sales team has clear visibility\n\n- Provide reporting and lead scoring analytics\n\nHowever, marketing automation tools don’t just support lead scoring to smooth handoffs to sales. You can also use lead scores to deliver more relevant and targeted marketing campaigns.\n\n\nH3: Segmentation (the secret superpower of lead scoring)\n\nThe whole practice of marketing automation depends on segmentation : automatically categorizing audience members based on demographics, firmographics, or behavior.\n\nIf that sounds exactly like lead scoring, you’re onto something. Lead scoring is a type of segmentation. And while it’s commonly used to determine MQL thresholds , lead scoring can also be used as a layer of segmentation to power marketing automation. What’s more, AI-driven lead scoring and AI-powered segmentation are pushing lead management into new, exciting directions.\n\n\nH2: Lead scoring tools: Lead nurturing\n\nMarketing automation uses segmentation to execute lead nurturing programs at scale. Lead nurturing means continually engaging with a would-be customer over time, sharing content and messages that educate and inform them about topics related to your products or services.\n\nLead scoring, segmentation, and nurturing are a powerful combination. By segmenting audiences based on their lead scores, marketers can deliver content according to the lead’s progress along their buying journey through stage-specific nurture campaigns.\n\nThat’s exactly how our team structures our lead nurture campaigns here at Act-On. As Suzy Balk, Sr. Marketing Campaigns Manager, describes, “When you have a lower lead score, we offer thought leadership content. We want to communicate ‘Here’s what we do — and we know what we’re talking about.’ Our intention is that you continue to take a look at Act-On and the other content we have that supports your business. Then, as your lead score grows, we start to introduce more mid-funnel and bottom-of-funnel content — maybe some case studies around the impact of marketing automation.”\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A woman looks at the camera holding a tablet, using lead scoring tools for marketing.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lead-scoring-tools-2-1024x683.jpg\n\n\nOnce a lead gets close to the MQL threshold, Suzy introduces content that would help them cross the metaphorical finish line: offering a demo, introducing the pricing page, or other bottom-of-funnel CTAs. At that point, a lead has engaged with multiple pieces of content, usually across different channels, and our team has gathered enough information through progressive profiling to determine that they’re fairly likely to be interested in our marketing automation platform.\n\n“It’s a lot less intrusive to introduce a demo or CTA once someone has engaged repeatedly, versus if they downloaded one piece of content,” Suzy says. “It really creates more warmth and familiarity with us as a solution.”\n\n\nH2: Advance your lead scoring expertise\n\nWe’ve covered a lot of ground in this series: the basics of lead scoring and its many benefits , how to build your own lead scoring model , and the lead scoring tools you’ll need to implement it at scale. And, thanks to Suzy, we’ve shared a lot of lead scoring best practices, examples, and inside tips along the way.

        "content": "Rising ROI expectations, increased inflation, and decreased consumer spending all add up to a CMO role that is quickly evolving.\n\n“Surveys show CMOs are concerned about demonstrating ROI, with another significant challenge being the generation of leads,” says Jeff Day, SVP of Marketing at Act-On Software.\n\nAs CMOs create strategies to solve these challenges in the coming months, their role is also evolving. CMSWire surveyed 700+ marketers and found the future will require:\n\n1. Increased cross-functional partnerships with sales\n\n2. More pressure to improve customer experience\n\n3. More robust data strategies\n\nAs leaders focus on these areas and build stronger customer acquisition, a few strategies can help increase success while navigating economic headwinds.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Cross-functional partnerships with sales and customer acquisition\n\nLeaders are familiar with the age-old rift between sales and marketing . The disconnect becomes especially apparent when it comes to missing revenue targets. You might hear things like:\n\n“Sales isn’t following up! We worked so hard to get those leads… .”\n\n“Marketing keeps sending us all these terrible leads; we’re sick of wasting our time!”\n\nHowever, this apparent challenge is actually a huge opportunity. And the key to capturing it is shifting from quantity to quality.\n\nWe recently talked with Kevin Butler, VP of Marketing & Strategy at Goose Digital.\n\nHe noted the need to consider MQLs in the context of your total addressable market (TAM). “When you look at your MQLs, does that number make sense with your TAM?” asks Kevin. “Your team might say, ‘We drove 4,000 leads this month.’ But what if there are only 200 companies in your target market? How is that possible?”\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Copy reads \"How marketing leaders say their role is changing, 35% more pressure to improve the customer experience, 28% customer lifetime value becoming more important, 23% too much focus on tech over message/strategy, Source CMSWire Insights State of the CMO Report 2023.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pipeilne-generation1-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nPart of this goes back to your lead-scoring system and talking with your sales team to ask questions like:\n\nWhat’s a “good lead” for you?\n\nWhich leads are the easiest for you to make contact with and qualify?\n\nFor marketing, that might mean narrowing the focus to provide higher-quality leads, and sales might need to dive deeper and get specific about what makes a good lead.\n\n\nH2: Improving the customer experience and customer acquisition\n\nNot surprisingly, survey respondents said another key factor that would shape a CMO’s role in the future is the customer experience. However, according to leaders, when considering experience improvements, they face two major challenges:\n\n1. Lack of budget\n\n2. Difficulty measuring ROI in marketing\n\nJeff explains that “cautiously optimistic buyers expect more value from their purchases in the current environment.” Building that value starts with nurturing prospects and continues long after the purchase.\n\nAs prospects and customers explore your website, open your emails, and engage on social media, they leave “digital breadcrumbs.” Collecting and knowing how to use this data is your team’s gateway to improving the customer experience.\n\nFor example, if you sell marketing automation, perhaps an existing customer attends a webinar about email deliverability and then downloads an eBook on the same topic. Tracking that behavior, your team can trigger campaigns to send that customer the most relevant resources to build pipeline and future cross-sells and upsells.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\nYou can also track behavioral data to identify prospects with a high sense of urgency. For example, a prospect who visits a product pricing page several times in a single day might receive a message asking if they’d like to connect with a salesperson. Allowing the prospect to self-identify their needs helps improve the experience.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll want to reconsider how you’re collecting first-party data. Marketers often ask for information such as name, email address, and phone number when gating content. However, according to Kevin, they rarely collect answers to questions like:\n\n1. When are you looking to make a purchase?\n\n2. What is your greatest need?\n\nGathering this information helps you build a stronger marketing pipeline that focuses on quality instead of quantity. It also helps you provide a better customer experience by identifying prospect interest and intent early.\n\n\nH2: More robust data strategies and customer acquisition\n\nWhen asking marketing leaders about metric accountability, the survey found that:\n\n1. 59% reported that leadership expects “marketing to have quantifiable, measurable results for everything in the department.”\n\n2. 41% said that “leadership accepts that some of the goals may not have quantifiable results.”\n\nRegardless of how your leadership team approaches results, marketing teams still face budget concerns, doing more with less, and demands around scaling.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: Copy reads: how marketing leaders say their role is changing, 43% demonstrating ROI, 35% increasing content production, 31% justifying budget, source CMSWire Insights State of the CMO Report 2023.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pipeline-generation2-1024x535.jpg\n\n\nAs you work to overcome these challenges, marketing automation is a tool that helps you understand your audience’s needs, supports pipeline marketing, and provides sales with better leads .\n\nThe challenge is that many marketing teams use tools that don’t adequately support their needs .Gartner shows that only 33% of marketers fully use their martech stack , which means that many teams pay for capabilities they aren’t using (hardly a good thing when budgets are shrinking).\n\n“Martech vendors, racing to build bigger and better features, ended up with so much “extra stuff” in their suites that getting even the most basic work done—let alone anything complicated—became difficult,” says Jeff. “The result is frustration and wasted time.”\n\nThis frustration is likely why 23% of marketers report they switched their marketing automation solution for a better alternative.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, when you sit down with your CEO to discuss marketing strategies, they want to know:\n\nHow does this program, strategy, or campaign translate to dollars?\n\n“When you can leverage data-driven strategies with tools like marketing automation, it’s easier to answer that question,” says Jeff.  “But you want to use tools that have the capabilities you need, instead of paying for functionality you don’t want or need.”\n\nIf you’re concerned about the rising cost of operating your marketing automation along with increasing complexity, check out our free marketing automation assessment tool. It will guide you to calculate the business benefits of a more efficient solution to navigate the way forward.",

Research says that 90% of consumers report their post-purchase experience is just as important as the quality of the products. And that process starts with your welcome email.\n\nWe recently spoke with our internal customer marketing expert, Jennifer Blanco . She explained that while you don’t need to overthink it, you do want to seize the opportunity to get your new relationship off to a great start.\n\n“The welcome email doesn’t need to be overly produced or analyzed, but if you don’t have one, you’re missing out,” says Jennifer. “It offers an opportunity to connect with your new customers and reassure them that they made the right choice.”\n\nNot sure where to start? We’ve got you covered with some of our favorite tips and best practices.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: What is a welcome email?\n\nA welcome email is the first communication you send to a new customer, and it’s one of your best opportunities to build a strong relationship between the customer and your brand.\n\nThe email might thank customers for their business, provide details for getting started, and explain what to expect in the future.\n\n\nH2: Why does your brand need a welcome email?\n\nDo you know the average open rate for an email? Stats vary, but across all industries, it’s roughly 36% .\n\nWant to know the average open rate for a welcome email?\n\nIt’s about 80% . Big difference, right?\n\nAfter making a purchase, customers want to hear from you. They’re excited about their new product or service, ready to get started, and very likely to open an email you send them. A welcome email lets you capture that opportunity .\n\nOf course, the first step is to decide that you need a welcome email, and the second is to decide what it will say.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A woman holds a closed laptop and looks at the screen to illustrate the idea of welcome emails]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/welcome-emails-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Best practices for great welcome emails\n\nJennifer explains that your welcome email can be as simple as a short welcome message for customers from the CEO, thanking them for their business and communicating your excitement. Or it can be a welcome email series, starting with the same email and following up with several more that include helpful tips or outline the onboarding process .\n\nHere are a few helpful suggestions as you craft your email or series of emails.\n\n\nH3: Send the welcome message immediately\n\nWe’ve found that customers are much more likely to open a welcome email sent within the first hour of purchase. So, you’ll want to send that email immediately after the purchase. The best way to do that is by using a marketing automation tool that allows you to create triggered emails .\n\n\nH3: Say thank you\n\nThis might feel like a no-brainer, but you’ll want to thank your new customer for making the purchase. Better yet, include the thank-you in the subject line to clarify the email’s purchase. For example, “Thank you for signing up with Act-On” or “Welcome to Act-On!”\n\n\nH3: Introduce your account team\n\nAs customers start using your product, you’ll want them to know who’s there to support them. That’s why Jennifer recommends introducing your account team in the new clients’ welcome email. If you can customize the email to include the specific rep assigned to their region or industry, that’s even better.\n\n\nH3: Provide helpful resources\n\nConsider providing links to your most helpful resources, such as your knowledge base , support site, community, or login portal (here’s an example of webinar resources we might include). Also, consider including your support offerings and hours.\n\n\nH3: Set expectations\n\nLet your customers and subscribers know how often you’ll send emails, the types of emails you’ll send, and how to unsubscribe or adjust their subscription settings. Providing these details is important to deliverability and ensuring future emails arrive in their inbox.\n\n\nH3: Include a simple call to action\n\nThe intent of welcome emails is to thank customers and embrace them as the newest members of your community. So, while you want to keep it simple, you can also include additional links that introduce relevant products, services, and content.\n\n\nH3: Send more than one welcome email\n\nYou don’t want to stuff your welcome email (or any email, for that matter!) with too much content. Doing so could overwhelm your customers, leading to lower click-through rates in the future. If you have a lot of content and resources to include, consider dividing them into several emails to create a welcome series.\n\nYou’ll also want to distinguish between an onboarding series and a welcome series . An onboarding series focuses on guiding new users or customers through the first step of successfully using your product, while a welcome series is more high-level.\n\n“The goal with a welcome series is to give the customer the nod for making the right choice and setting the tone for what’s to come,” says Jennifer.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A woman works in an office, highlighted by animated yellow bubble.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/welcome-emails-2-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Optimize your growth\n\nMastering your welcome email is an important part of starting a positive relationship with your customer, but it’s also part of something much bigger: customer marketing .\n\nCustomer marketing is focused on outreach to existing customers, promoting retention and growing revenue through strategic upsells and cross-sells. Research shows that repeat customers spend 67% more than new customers and convert at higher rates, so it’s a huge opportunity.\n\nSo, yes, master the welcome email, but also consider how it fits into your larger customer marketing strategy and how it will grow the customer’s lifetime value. Do you want to know the tricks for keeping your customers coming back for more? We’ve given you our favorites in our on-demand webinar .\n\n\nH2: Best welcome emails examples\n\nWant a starting point? Here’s an example of a welcome message from our internal swipe file. Use the welcome email template as inspiration so you don’t have to start from scratch.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult.

Customers who participated were more likely to stay with us – their retention rate went up by 25%.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for creative ways to improve your retention marketing, we’ve shared our framework for reaching more customers and keeping them happy.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: Customer-Driven Marketing Strategy: The Three Parts\n\nHave you ever attended an event that provided high-level information only to find that once you got into actually doing the work, you were a little lost? Our refreshed Power-Up Series decided to tackle this challenge through a three-part framework:\n\nThe high-level webinar. The webinar is our “main event” and focuses on a topic we think our audience will love (more on that shortly). For example, if the topic is email deliverability , our experts provide a high-level overview.\n\nThe workshop. The workshop takes that high-level information and helps our customers apply it to their exact situation. Think about it like college: You attend the lecture and then attend labs to actually do the work.\n\nOffice hours. Speaking of college, we designed regular office hours to meet the customers where they’re at on any issue they need help with (not necessarily related to the current topic). Customers can bring their questions to our experts and work one-on-one to solve them.\n\nWe also created dedicated landing pages for each topic with additional resources, such as articles or guides. These pages receive a significant amount of traffic. In 2022, we had 1,985 views on the landing pages. In 2023, views jumped to 4,311, marking a 217% increase.\n\n\nH2: How We Find Topics Our Customers Love\n\nHow do you know what topics your customers will love? Of course, we started by partnering with Support about frequently asked questions. We use data and anecdotal feedback to guide our decisions, and we also look at:\n\nIndustry trends. What trends are happening in your industry right now? This is often a great starting point. For example, Google and Yahoo launched new requirements to help improve email security and user experience earlier this year. Our internal data showed deliverability is a popular topic with our customers, so we decided to do a Power-Up on the topic. Attendance broke our records for a single event, with 430 registrants.\n\nTraffic data. One of the great benefits of building a landing page for each Power-Up is that we can track traffic data to gauge customer interest. We use this data to determine what topics our audience needs help with and to guide future content creation.\n\nWebinar participant surveys. Asking your attendees to fill out a survey is a great way to understand how to improve on an existing topic and develop future retention marketing content. First party data is an underused intelligence source for marketers. Before relaunching the series, we sent an email survey post-webinar to gather feedback, but the response rate was low. With the relaunch, we took a new approach: survey attendees directly on the Zoom platform. The response rate increased to 25%.\n\nHere are some of the questions we asked:\n\n1. Did you find this session beneficial?\n\n2. What percentage of today’s webinar was new information to you?\n\n3. Would you like more information about {X} topic?\n\n4. Are there any other topics that would be helpful to you?\n\nWith this data, we could follow up with customers who want to learn more about a specific topic and use their feedback to guide future customer marketing efforts.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: In a conference room, a diverse group watches a customer retention marketing webinar on a screen]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retention-marketing-1-1024x796.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Tracking Attendance Rates and Planning\n\nWhen sending promotional emails for customer retention marketing webinars, the last thing you want is a poor response. That’s why we look at historical data to plan future events.\n\nHere’s what our internal data says:\n\n- Avoid July and August. Many of our customers are out for summer vacations.\n\n- Skip March. It’s often a time for spring break travel.\n\n- Pause during December. Everyone has checked out for the holidays, so we may as well wait until Q1.\n\nAlso, our internal webinar expert Kelsey Yen, has another tip for sending promotional emails .\n\n“I send my webinar promotional emails the same day of the week and time of day I plan to hold the event,” says Kelsey. “If engagement is high, it’s an early indicator that the time might work well for the audience.”\n\nWhen thinking about webinar marketing, you can also look at past email open rates to determine the day and time that typically works best for your customers.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: business person pumps fists in victory in a teal circle, illustrating the idea of retention marketing]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retention-marketing-2-1024x683.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Customer Retention Marketing and Adding Value\n\nFrom the moment customers decide to purchase our product, there’s a value exchange. We always want to be on the right side of that value exchange because once customers feel like they’re not getting enough, we’re at risk for retention problems.\n\nTo that point, I’ll share something we learned early in the Power-Up Series: Don’t sell. Whatever you create should be focused on helping your customers get the most from their existing products without any sales pitches. That idea alone could help improve any customer retention program.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\nAnd if you need help generating higher customer lifetime value and improving retention marketing , we have a webinar for you!

        "content": "Marketing and sales teams are famously frenemies. They share common goals— driving revenue for their company —but poor communication regularly gets in the way of these two teams working together. Sales and marketing alignment is no small task, but it’s not a mystery. We know what causes misalignment:\n\n- No shared understanding around who we’re trying to reach.\n\n- Inconsistent methods of measuring success.\n\n- Poorly integrated tech that doesn’t support simple handoffs.\n\n- Frequently assigning blame but rarely sharing credit for revenue results.\n\n- Real or imagined cultural clashes (“Marketers are mired in process and research.” “Sales only cares about hitting targets, by any means necessary.”).\n\n- And, sometimes, a lack of trust and personal relationships.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: In a dark office, a diverse group of sales and marketing team members discuss alignment on key goals over a laptop.]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingalignment1-1024x576.jpg\n\n\nWe also know there are concrete steps every team can take to get back on the same page. Read on to learn how manageable tasks like documenting buyer personas, developing a lead scoring system, and improving tech integrations can achieve the impossible: sales and marketing working together.\n\n\nH2: Sales and Marketing Best Practices: Why Work Together?\n\nThe “marketing vs. sales” challenge is a tale as old as B2B time. It’s always been a problem—but in the modern, multichannel, digital-first era of B2B buying , this misalignment puts customer experience at risk.\n\nToday’s buyers are more reliant on digital information to move them along their journey. Research from Gartner shows that buyers only spend 17% of their time meeting with potential suppliers—that’s all suppliers, not just the winning solution. The majority of their buying journey hours are now spent on independent research.\n\nAnd the B2B buying journey is no longer a linear progression from marketing to sales, with one point of handoff along the way. Buyers are likely bouncing from digital channels to 1:1 sales conversations and back again as they learn about possible solutions, evaluate their options, and work with internal buying committees.\n\nWhen sales and marketing teams aren’t aligned, those buyers can feel whiplash as they progress through their customer journey. And the teams themselves will have a more difficult time meeting their goals and doing their best work.\n\nGiven this new normal, it’s more important than ever that sales and marketing teams work well together. It’s no longer about smoothing a one-time handoff—it’s about ongoing collaboration that delivers a seamless experience.\n\n\nH2: How sales and marketing teams are (usually) structured\n\nLet’s start at the beginning: how marketing and sales teams are structured. Every organization will have their own approach based on their size, growth stage, and goals, but these basic functions are common across most B2B companies.\n\nMarketing teams usually include:\n\n- Demand generation marketers who are responsible for generating and nurturing new leads .\n\n- Content marketers who strategically produce content across the lifecycle (including sales enablement materials).\n\n- Marketing operations specialists (MOPS) who manage the technology and processes that support marketing (like a marketing automation platform).\n\n- Product marketers who develop go-to-market strategies and positioning .\n\nMarketing teams can include many more roles, like SEO specialists, PR pros, creatives, and brand marketers, but the above teams tend to be the most intertwined with sales functions.\n\nSales teams usually include:\n\n- Business development representatives, or BDRs, who conduct outbound prospecting or do cold outreach to generate new leads.\n\n- Sales development reps, or SDRs, who vet inbound leads (in other words, leads generated by marketing) with early conversations, usually with the goal of scheduling meetings for senior salespeople.\n\n- Account executives, or AEs, who work with prospective buyers through the final stages of their journey and, ideally, close deals and manage ongoing customer relationships.\n\n- Sales operations specialists who manage the technology and processes that support sales (like a CRM).\n\nSometimes, SDRs will report into marketing, because they’re working closely with marketing-generated leads. Occasionally, BDRs will report into marketing, because they’re responsible for generating new leads. Sometimes one operations specialist supports both sales and marketing. But usually, these groups are separated into different parts of the org chart, eventually laddering up to the CEO.\n\nThat’s where misalignment and miscommunication starts—but not where it ends.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: A diverse group of sales people shake hands across a conference table with a marketer in the foreground to illustrate sales and marketing allignment]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/salesandmarketingalignment2-1024x693.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: How silos form and tensions build between marketing and sales\n\nWe all know what the finger-pointing sounds like when an organization doesn’t meet its revenue goals.\n\n“Sales doesn’t follow up—we worked hard to get those leads!”\n\n“Marketing keeps sending us all these worthless leads—and keeps wasting our time!”\n\nThese are incredibly common scenarios. Research from Gartner shows that sales teams typically believe only 44% of MQLs are actually promising . That’s a big problem, because that means one of two things: marketers are wasting a lot of time generating the wrong kinds of leads, or sales has a skewed idea of what “promising leads” should look like.\n\nFor two teams with such closely related big-picture goals, there’s often a huge disconnect around what makes a “good lead”, and when best to engage them in one-on-one sales conversations.\n\nThis primarily happens when marketing and sales teams lack alignment around:\n\n- Their target audience—who are we trying to reach?\n\n- Their metrics and definitions—what’s an SQL, anyway?\n\n- Their technology and processes—how do our systems talk to each other?\n\nMisalignment also happens when there’s an overall lack of communication, respect, and clear responsibilities. That often comes from the top—when sales and marketing leaders are dealing with office politics, power struggles, and fighting over budgets, their downstream teams tend to lack the organizational support needed to foster healthy collaboration. And when these teams are siloed, it’s easy for common stereotypes around the clashing personalities of sales and marketing professionals to set the narrative.\n\n\nH2: The costs of poor sales and marketing collaboration\n\nWhen this constant blame game and lack of collaboration is the norm, not only is the work environment less pleasant, the organization suffers. Poorly aligned sales and marketing teams don’t learn from each other, missing the chance to improve their messaging and talking tracks. Teams waste time on generating, nurturing, and talking with the wrong leads. Leaders develop inaccurate forecasts based on inconsistent metrics. And buyers miss out on a cohesive customer experience. That’s enough of the negatives. In the next piece in this series, we’ll pivot to how to solve some of these thorny alignment problems through clear planning and strategy .",

        "content": "When we talk about data-driven marketing , we typically imagine a blissfully quantitative utopia. We measure and track consumer behavior across the lifecycle, and attribute conversions with precision. Every element of our campaigns are A/B tested and refined in real-time. Our writers and designers optimize every creative asset based on past performance. And over time, our marketing strategies and tactics zero in on the ROI bullseye of low-cost MQLs and sky-high conversion rates.\n\nIt’s a nice fantasy. It’s also wildly out of reach for most marketing teams in our current age of consumer privacy and increasingly complex buying journeys . Third-party cookies are crumbling, consumer data is kept within walled gardens, and consumers are learning about products and brands through private or offline channels that even the fanciest attribution software can’t measure.\n\nThis means B2B marketers are coming to terms with the idea that marketing attribution just doesn’t work anymore — if it ever did.\n\nAnd that’s a good thing.\n\nBecause obsessing over attribution forces talented marketers to over-index on “proven” channels (usually paid) at the cost of trusting their gut and building long-term relationships with their audience.\n\nSo if marketers can be freed from the shackles of tracking every behavior and calculating the precise ROI of every activity, that means they can return to obsessing over their customers instead of performance metrics.\n\nIn this new era, data becomes a useful tool that serves our marketing — not the other way around.\n\n\nH2: The real-life principles of data-driven marketing\n\nFor today’s leaders, data-driven marketing centers around using the right data at the right time to inform your strategy and improve your performance — while leaving room for creativity, intuition, and experimentation.\n\nWe’ll explore some specific tactics in a moment, but big-picture, here are some core principles of data-driven marketing in 2024.\n\n- Prioritize first-party data : Collect your own data whenever you can — like your website, applications, and owned channels.\n\n- Connect data sources: Make sure your first-party behavioral data, CRM data, campaign performance data, and any data supplied by a third-party are centralized — ideally, within a single source of truth.\n\n- Segment your audience: Use the data you have to develop your ICP and buyer personas, and segment your audience according to industry, role, company size, location, or whatever characteristics matter most to your business.\n\n- Personalize content and messaging : When possible, create variations of content and messages tailored to your audience segments to provide a more relevant experience.\n\n- Evaluate campaign performance: Look at engagement metrics and conversion rates to get a better understanding of what’s working, and what’s not.\n\n- Test, experiment, and refine: Do more of what’s working, and tweak what’s not. Try something new to see how it lands. Measure, adjust, and measure again, with the goal of incremental improvements over time.\n\n- Analyze and report: Get the clearest understanding you can of how your marketing activities translate to sales. Define your metrics and your approach, and share them.\n\nThe overriding goal here is to use data-driven marketing techniques to figure out who your customers are, and what works to reach them. Do more of those things — but don’t limit your investments to only those things, and keep experimenting to see what innovative and unproven tactics can move the needle.\n\n\nH2: The challenges of the old data-driven marketing model\n\nOf course, in order to shift your approach to data-driven marketing, you’ll need to convince your C-suite that the notion of data as the end-all, be-all path to good marketing just doesn’t work. So let’s unpack the big picture challenges at play in 2024.\n\n\nH3: Increased privacy regulations\n\nSince 2018, we’ve seen a seismic shift in the landscape of consumer data privacy. Government regulations like GDPR and CPRA have beefed up the requirements advertisers need to follow around obtaining, using, and sharing consumer data. At the same time, tech companies like Apple and Google have raced to get ahead of additional legislation by introducing their own privacy protections to their web browsers, email clients , and mobile devices. Most notably, Google is in the final stages of eliminating the third-party cookies that allowed advertisers to track and target consumers across the internet.\n\nFor marketers, the undeniable end result is less easy access to data — especially third-party data, which probably wasn’t all that reliable in the first place .\n\n\nH3: Whatever’s happening on “dark social”\n\nYou can’t measure what you can’t observe. And an awful lot of your prospects’ buying journey happens on “ dark social ” — in private spaces like messaging apps, email, or SMS. Or, offline entirely.\n\nMaybe your prospect heard your brand name-dropped on a podcast, or mentioned in a Slack community. They might have asked their actual human friends for a product recommendation. Or saw your CEO speak at a conference, and then looked up your brand in a direct search when they were in-market months later.\n\nThese activities are difficult-to-impossible to monitor, let alone measure — or include in attribution models.\n\n\nH3: Measurement does not equal attribution\n\nThat leads us to the problem of provable attribution — the unfulfilled promise of data-driven marketing. This mindset suggests that marketers can track their leads’ behavior from throughout every step of their buying process, using expensive software and advanced statistical models to weigh and quantify how each touchpoint impacts conversion.\n\nBut as Rand Fishkin and other marketing leaders have been emphasizing lately, this kind of attribution modeling usually isn’t the best use of marketers’ time. For one, as we’ve just discussed, consumer data is getting harder to access, and much of the buying journey takes place on channels we can’t monitor. Second, there’s a big difference between measurement and attribution — despite what Google, Facebook, and other advertising platforms (whose number one goal is to take more of your marketing budget) would have you believe.\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, this all means an organization that becomes over-reliant on provable attribution can overlook important channels and undervalue brand and marketing activities that don’t have easily quantifiable ROI.\n\n\nH3: The lack of experimentation\n\nThere’s a lot to learn from what kind of messaging and content has performed well with your audience in the past. But if historical data is the guiding force of creative decision-making, you’re leaving very little room for innovation and experimentation.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative data should help your strategists and creative teams understand your audience and inform a thorough understanding of their needs and pain points. But it shouldn’t be a limiting force that takes an “unproven” idea off the table — a real danger of the most devoted data-driven marketing leaders.\n\n\nH3: The practical difficulties of applying data\n\nCollecting data is hard enough, but our research shows that marketers’ biggest challenge is figuring out how to actually apply data to marketing.\n\nThis can happen for many reasons. Some marketers experience “ analysis paralysis ” — being so overwhelmed by parsing through large quantities of data that it takes a long time to actually make a decision. Others have to deal with internal silos that restrict access to the data they could use. Some marketing orgs lack a clear understanding of how to interpret specific insights into actionable steps.\n\nAnd some may be so intimidated by the all-or-nothing mentality of “data-driven marketing” that they don’t believe the data they already have can make a meaningful difference — without investing in five or six-figure software.\n\nDespite all of these challenges, data-driven marketing is a worthwhile endeavor. We just need to define and contextualize it for marketers working in real environments with real constraints.\n\n\nH2: How to improve data-driven marketing today\n\nLet’s put these principles into practice: how can you start improving your data-driven approach right now?\n\n\nH3: Optimizing campaigns with engagement data midstream\n\nKeep an eye on campaign performance and look for opportunities to intervene and improve in time to impact results. For example, if you notice that your webinar promotion is disproportionately attracting registrations from the finance sector, you can quickly spin up a segmented invite highlighting the relevance for your other ICP targets.\n\n\nH3: Using lead scoring to qualify MQLs for sales\n\nLead scoring is a relatively straightforward way to use data to smooth out the marketing-to-sales handoff. Partner with your sales team to develop a lead scoring model tailored to your ICP — aligning quantitative scores with demographic and firmographic factors that matter most. Next, layer in behavior scoring that prioritizes activities that indicate real buying interest (like webinar attendance or a buying guide download). Then, set an MQL threshold that everyone agrees indicates a lead is most likely ready to meet with sales.\n\nBonus point: implement an AI-powered predictive lead scoring system that incorporates real-time sales conversion data, meaning your model looks for documented patterns of behavior that lead to actual conversions and closed deals.\n\n\nH3: Analyze how users interact with your website\n\nBehavioral analysis tools like Hotjar or Lucky Orange create heatmaps to visualize how visitors interact with your website and content, and help you identify opportunities to improve usability and conversions. For example, you notice that prospects who click through a testimonial carousel are more likely to book a demo — but your testimonials are buried deep on the bottom of your homepage. Given this insight, you can relocate your social proof higher up on the page and monitor how (or if) the change impacts conversions.\n\n\nH3: Look beyond email open and click-through rates\n\nEmail open and clickthrough rates are losing credibility with marketing leaders, thanks to artificial inflation from mail provider changes and corporate scanning bots (designed to check email security by opening messages and clicking every link). Instead, look further downstream in your email campaigns — when readers click a link to your website, how long do they engage with that content? Where do they go next? What meaningful outcomes — like webinar registrations, content downloads, or completed video views — are your emails driving? Moving beyond early indicators like opens and clicks will focus your time and attention on the data that actually matters.\n\n\nH3: Combine data sources to identify content opportunities\n\nLooking at multiple data sources about the same content assets can help surface valuable opportunities. For example, say a certain page gets great campaign engagement — like time-on-page after an email click or number of social shares — but has low organic entrances and pageviews. That indicates that while the subject matter is relevant to your subscribers and followers, you may not be optimizing the post for the related keywords your broader audience could be searching for. Time to do some keyword research and optimize accordingly.\n\n\nH3: Share data across teams\n\nLevel up your data-driven marketing efforts by building a data-driven culture across the organization. Your sales reps should know which blog posts are highest-performing, so they can share them with their prospects. And it goes both ways — you should know which questions come up most often during customer success calls, so you can build educational content for customer marketing campaigns.\n\n\nH3: Use AI to power natural language search\n\nNot all marketers are analytics experts, or have time to go digging for insights within raw data or complex dashboards. But when your analytics layer includes AI-powered search , you can use natural language queries (like “Which email campaign drove the most engagement last month?” ) to mine your data for actionable insights, all on your own — no overworked analyst or SQL skills required.\n\n\nH2: Get the most out of your marketing automation data\n\nUltimately, knowing when to rely on data is just as important as knowing you need to rely on it in the first place. Don’t get bogged down in data that doesn’t actually matter — focus your time and efforts on data-driven techniques that help you reach new leads, improve conversions, and lower acquisition costs. And while you don’t need a perfectly optimized mar-tech stack to get started, actionable analytics makes data-driven marketing much easier.\n\nLearn more in our recent webinar about optimizing your marketing automation platform with robust integrations, predictive lead scoring, and impactful analytics that supercharge your marketing — but keep you in the driver’s seat.",

That’s why we use our own growth marketing software to automate dozens of marketing initiatives every day. And perhaps our most reliable and effective automation feature is automated email nurture campaigns .\n\nNever heard of them? Not sure how to use them? Already using them but without much success?\n\nKeep reading to learn more about email nurture campaigns and how to get the most out of this digital marketing automation goldmine.\n\n\nH2: What Are Triggered Email Nurture Campaigns?\n\nDifferent than standard email nurturing campaigns (which generally send a series of emails in a predetermined cadence), triggered emails are designed to fire as soon as someone who is visiting one of your digital properties performs a specific action.\n\nSending triggered emails based on user behavior is one of the best ways to personalize your digital marketing campaigns because it allows you to tailor your messaging based on those behaviors. In fact, according to a study conducted by WebFx, triggered email campaigns have a 70.5% higher open rate than traditional email nurturing efforts.\n\nOther benefits of triggered email nurture campaigns include:\n\n- Increased user engagement\n\n- Higher click-through rates and conversions\n\n- Better customer retention and upselling\n\n- Improved user experience and satisfaction\n\nBut if you really want to succeed, the name of the game is relevance.\n\nFor example, trigger campaign marketing can be useful if a known potential customer visits your website looking to learn more about a particular product or service line but leaves the page before downloading an informative asset or completing a contact form. You can seize this opportunity to engage by sending them an immediate follow-up email letting them know about all the great content or products they’re missing out on.\n\nBased on their engagement with your first email, you can add this contact to a segmented list and continue messaging them in a related topic-based automated email program . This way you remain top of mind while also gradually moving your prospect through the sales funnel.\n\n\nH2: Trigger Email Nurture Campaign Use Cases That Work!\n\nSince trigger campaign marketing is based on timeliness and relevance, you need to build emails that deliver the right messaging based on how the prospect is (or isn’t) engaging with your digital properties and content.\n\nLet’s take a look at five trigger-based marketing examples you can use to continue the conversation after the fact to improve lead generation and retain loyal customers!\n\n\nH3: 1) Deliver on Your Promise\n\nThe majority of triggered emails are designed to follow-up on a positive user interaction, such as subscribing to a newsletter or downloading an eBook or other event. Therefore, it’s no surprise that these campaigns are so successful. After all, the recipients are actually looking forward to receiving your emails! (How often can you honestly say that?)\n\nTo take full advantage of all this goodwill, you need to deliver on your promise. That is, you need to send purposeful emails that confirm (and affirm) the customer’s action. So if someone really loves your blog and signs up to receive your monthly newsletter, but they don’t receive a welcome email confirming they’ve done so, they might wonder if they filled out your form correctly or if there’s an issue with their email server. Either way, this is a terrible user experience that reflects poorly on your organization and will likely cost you what might’ve been a promising lead.\n\nFailing to send an introductory email might also make your recipient forget that they signed up to receive content from you in the first place. This increases the probability of them marking your message as Spam, which could negatively impact your deliverability and your nurturing efforts as a whole.\n\nIt’s best practice to always remind your consumers that they signed up to receive emails and reassure them that you’re doing exactly what you said you were going to do by following up on user actions with trigger emails.\n\n\nH2: The Amazingly Effective Email Marketing Automation Guide\n\n\nH3: 2) Target Non-Action Prospects\n\nIt’s not always about the actions your prospects are taking. In fact, some of the most successful triggered email nurture campaigns are those that focus on known website visitors who didn’t perform a desired action before bouncing from the page. You already know these potential customers are at least somewhat interested in what you have to say or sell, so why not dangle a carrot by shooting out a cheerful and personalized email to those users who have visited your various service pages?\n\nOr, you could send a re-engagement email to existing leads who haven’t interacted with your nurturing email campaigns over the last few months. Perhaps you can offer a special discount or a limited free trial to see if you can get them engaged. Once they respond to the pitch, of course, you’ll want to place them in a new series of automated emails.\n\n\nH3: 3) Don’t Forget About Existing Customers\n\nEvery now and then we need to remind ourselves that keeping our existing customers happy should be our top priority. What’s more, people who have already bought from you are your best leads for potential upsells! And since you have all the information (and permission, in most cases) you need to market to these people, they’re perfect candidates for triggered email nurture campaigns.\n\nSo when a customer makes a purchase, you should create an email nurture sequence that includes…\n\n- Immediately sending them a confirmation email thanking them for the sale and letting them know when and how they’ll be receiving their product.\n\n- Once the product ships, sending another email letting the customer know an estimated arrival time along with a tracking number.\n\n- Finally, when you know the product has arrived, send an email asking for feedback or giving additional information on how to get the most value out of what your customer has just received.\n\nAll three of these follow-up emails present a great opportunity to sneak in additional product or content recommendations to continue the sales engagement.\n\n\nH3: 4) Messaging Based on Lead Score\n\nEvery company scores and prioritizes their leads differently, but all organizations should have a threshold for determining a marketing qualified lead (MQL) and a protocol for passing those MQLs to Sales. Once a prospect meets that threshold (whether by opening an email, visiting a webpage, or clicking on a paid ad), you should send an automated trigger email to the prospect that invites them to take a more dedicated action like scheduling a call or booking a demo. By this point, the prospect should be extremely familiar with your brand, educated about your products and service lines, and even doing some competitive research, which means now is the time to take this relationship to the next level.\n\nConversely, MQLs often drop below your lead scoring threshold following a period of inactivity or by doing things you’ve determined a negative action, such as unsubscribing from your monthly newsletter. This is another good opportunity for you to attempt to re-engage with the prospect by offering highly personalized content and/or an exclusive offer. Once the prospect is requalified, be sure your sales team reaches out to strike while the iron is hot!\n\n\nH3: 5) Instruct Your Customers on How to Use Your Products and Services\n\nThere’s nothing more frustrating than making an expensive purchase and then being completely lost about how to actually use the thing you just bought. Familiarity breeds a lot of assumptions, and just because you think something is easy to use or self-explanatory doesn’t mean your customers will feel the same. Thankfully, this provides a great opportunity to trigger a helpful email!\n\nWhenever your customer makes a purchase and then receives their product or service, send a follow-up email providing clear and simple directions for how to implement or use it. You can then create an email nurture campaign series that details some best practices and innovative techniques to help them get the most out of their purchase.\n\nAgain, this is highly personalized material that keeps prospects and customers engaged with your brand over time.\n\n\nH2: Event-Triggered Email Nurturing Software From Act-On\n\nAs you can see, event-triggered email nurturing is a great way to connect with interested prospects, promising leads, and existing customers to deliver relevant and personalized messaging that keeps you and your brand top of mind throughout the sales cycle and beyond.\n\nAt Act-On, we believe that your customers are on a journey and trigger emails are one of our strongest product features and marketing tactics you can use to help guide them along the way.

        "content": "Lead generation is on the to-do list of most marketers. And sure, you might have some successful strategies in place, but wouldn’t it be nice to capture some easier wins?\n\nOne of the best ways to land these wins is through customer marketing.\n\nWhy?\n\nCompanies have a 60% to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer, compared to a brand-new one (the latter is only 5% to 20%). Research also shows existing customers spend 67% more than new customers.\n\nThe bottom line is that existing customers are easier to sell to, and they buy more.\n\nSo, if you want to capture more of that revenue, a great place to start is customer marketing.\n\n\nH3: What is customer marketing?\n\nCustomer marketing is the strategy of continuing to actively market to your customers after you’ve made the initial sale by building relationships and improving your brand experience. Customer marketing helps promote retention, and foster upsells and cross-sells. The customers who know, love, and use your products are much more likely to purchase additional products and services in the future.\n\nAnd if they don’t love your products (yet), you want to provide value and help continuously, so when it comes time for renewal (or shopping the competitors), staying with your product will be the clear choice.\n\n\nH3: Why is customer-centric marketing important?\n\nThe cost of acquiring a new customer is roughly four to five times the cost of retaining an existing one. And yes, customer acquisition is important for growth, but if you don’t balance that with marketing to your existing customers, you can end up in a vicious cycle of churn and burn.\n\nHere’s what that looks like:\n\n1. You onboard customer X.\n\n2. You lose customer X.\n\n3. You spend 4-5x more to replace customer X.\n\n4. And the cycle grows longer and more expensive…\n\nCustomer relationship marketing helps you to correct this imbalance to retain more customers, upsell, and cross-sell to achieve a higher customer lifetime value .\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH3: What customer marketing strategies should I use?\n\nAs you create your customer-led marketing strategy, most organizations have a couple of primary goals.\n\n1. Create happy customers. Why would they want to switch to a competitor? They love you!\n\n2. Grow lifetime customer value. They love you so much that they’re presold when you recommend other products and services.\n\nHere are a few strategies for reaching these goals:\n\n\nH2: Personalize onboarding\n\nOnboarding email: “We’re really great. Our product is really great. Us, us, us… {continues with corporate speak and canned messaging}. ”\n\nThe customer’s response: Delete.\n\nOops, that didn’t go so well.\n\nLet’s try again.\n\nWhen your customer buys your product or service, you want to send them a personalized welcome email and onboarding series . The content should be specific to the product they purchased and give them resources, guides, and training that help them successfully use the product.\n\nAnd remember, once you create this email, don’t set it and forget it.\n\nContinue to talk to your customer service and salespeople. Ask about the problems that customers have during the onboarding process and then use that intelligence to create progressively better content.\n\n\nH2: Map your customer success journey\n\nMap out the specific journey your customers take after purchase. The first step, which we mentioned above, is that welcome email. Now, you’ll want to target a few more touch points. Here are several to consider adding to your list:\n\n- Adoption and training. Your customer is brand new when it comes to using your product; what do they need to know? Again, chat with your sales and customer service teams and ask questions about where new customers get stuck. Use the answers to these questions to create training and resources to solve common problems and support your new customers.\n\n- Help customers understand the overall value. Continue showing customers the great ways to use your product, and reinforce its value. For example,\n\n“Hey, customer, did you know you can do this cool thing? Customer X just recently grew revenue by Y% using this exact feature. Give it a try! Let us know how it works for you.”\n\nAnd here’s a pro tip: You can use marketing automation to set up these experiences .\n\n- Expand the relationship, cross-sell, and upsell. Once your customer has some wins with your products, consider telling them about complementary products and upsells. Explain how these solutions can help them continue to grow their success.\n\n- Ask for feedback. Don’t wait until you’re close to renewal to ask for feedback. Ask early and ask often. Then, take that feedback to your team, look for ways to improve the product or service, and let the customer know how you’re using their feedback.\n\nThese are just a few potential options, but the point is to start thinking about the customer journey and then set up touch points along that journey to create stronger relationships.\n\n\n[CONTENT IMAGE: customer marketing represented by a shipping client looking at content on his tablet]\nSource: https://act-on.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/customer-marketing-1-1024x536.jpg\n\n\n\nH2: Segment users with similar characteristics\n\nWe can’t answer the question “What is consumer marketing?” without mentioning segmentation.\n\nThat’s because it’s the framework that allows you to personalize at scale.\n\nRemember that welcome email we mentioned earlier? You can use it to segment your customers even further and help them reach their goals. For example, if you sell marketing automation, you might ask the new customer about their goals during that first welcome email.\n\nLet’s say you learn their primary goal is to grow revenue through email marketing. You can use that data to segment new customers by interest and then provide personalized training, tools, and resources targeted to email marketing. Or you might discover a top interest is improving email deliverability. As a result, you send a comprehensive guide written by your internal gurus on the topic (by the way, we actually wrote that guide! You can check it out here ).\n\nWhen your customers reach their goals faster, your retention strategies will be more effective, and they’ll naturally want to grow their relationship with you.\n\n\nH3: Using Marketing Automation to Boost Customer Retention\n\n\nH2: Measuring your results\n\nAs with any marketing strategy, you’ll want to show results, right? And while customer marketing metrics are tricky to track since programs happen over a long period, you can still track them. A couple of metrics to consider include:\n\nLifetime customer value (LCV). LCV is the total revenue generated from a single customer throughout your entire relationship with them. For example, if a customer spends $100 per purchase, makes five purchases per year, and has been with your company for three years, their LCV would be $100 x 5 x 3 = $1,500.\n\nROI. With ROI, you measure the profitability of your customer marketing efforts as related to their cost. For example, if a customer marketing campaign costs $10,000 and generates $50,000 in revenue, your ROI would be ($50,000 – $10,000 / $10,000) * 100 = 400%.\n\nNew customer acquisition will undoubtedly be part of your marketing strategy in the future. But when you balance that strategy with powerful customer marketing efforts, you can make faster strides toward growth because you won’t be battling churn.\n\nDo you want to know more tricks for keeping customers?

        "content": "Imagine going on a blind date. All you know about the person sitting across from you is their name, maybe what they do for a living, and that your cousin Helen thinks you might get along.\n\nBut before you have a chance to ask any questions or get to know them better, they give you a big smile and say, “It’s so nice to meet you. I’d love to show you around my apartment. When’s a good time for you to come by this week?”\n\nHow inappropriate! But not entirely unlike when a colleague sends you a link to a gated ebook, you give your contact info to download it, and then get a phone call from a sales rep the same day. You don’t want a demo of their software — you haven’t even had time to read their content yet.\n\nLuckily for marketers, lead scoring exists. Lead scoring helps organizations move prospects along their buying journey in a structured, strategic way — which is especially helpful considering how complex buying journeys have become.\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\nAccording to research from Gartner, B2B buyers are spending more time researching online, and less time interacting directly with sales — as little as 5-6% of their total buying journey . And it takes an average of 20 touches with a brand before a prospect becomes a potentially successful lead for the sales team.\n\nFor marketing and sales teams, that handoff is a potential minefield. Too early, and everyone wastes time. Too late, and potential deals may slip through the cracks.\n\nLead scoring helps sales and marketing teams navigate handoffs by providing a quantitative approach to qualifying leads: assigning a predetermined number of points to a lead based on certain characteristics or behaviors. Marketing and sales teams can look at a prospect’s lead score and determine whether they’re ready for a sales conversation or need to be nurtured. For example:\n\n- Junior employee downloaded an introductory guide to your general area of expertise? Keep them engaged with more content, and add a few points to their score every time they engage.\n\n- Senior manager visited your pricing page, downloaded a product comparison sheet, and watched a video demo? Score those strong purchase indicators highly and send these white-hot leads to sales.\n\nNo guesswork, no gut instinct — it’s all in the numbers.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll dive into how lead scoring works, how to build a framework, and the marketing and sales superpowers it can unlock.\n\n\nH2: How does lead scoring work?\n\nLead scoring helps organizations avoid the potential headaches of passing leads from marketing to sales — but that only scratches the surface of what a strategic lead scoring framework can deliver.\n\nFirst, a very quick overview of how lead scoring works. (We’ll give a step-by-step guide to building a lead scoring framework in the next chapter).\n\nMarketing and sales teams usually manage lead scoring within their marketing automation and CRM software, and lead metrics are divided into two categories: implicit and explicit.\n\n- Explicit data is provided intentionally by your lead, such as company, location, industry, and job title.\n\n- Implicit data is observed behavioral information, such as webpages visited, email engagement, content downloads, or form completions. Smart marketers can use these behaviors to deduce what topics a prospect may be interested in, and how close they might be to purchasing.\n\nEvery piece of data your team gathers about a lead “earns” a certain number of points. Once a lead crosses a predetermined threshold, they become a marketing-qualified lead (MQL) and your automation software hands them off to sales for one-on-one conversations. The points you assign will depend entirely on your business and your audience.\n\n\nH2: Lead scoring examples\n\nFor example, at Act-On, we sell marketing automation software to SMBs and enterprise organizations. Our leads might look something like this:\n\n- Debbie is the Director of Marketing at a 2,000-person manufacturing company. She entered our funnel through a partner, visited our homepage and about page, downloaded a guide to implementing automation software, and signed up for a webinar about comparing marketing automation providers.\n\n- Tyson is a small business owner. He wants to improve marketing for his local food cart, and entered our funnel through a Google search for “how to do email marketing”. He downloaded our “Introduction to Email Marketing” guide, but never interacted with any of our subsequent nurture programs.\n\nAs you can imagine, Debbie the Director of Marketing racked up quite a few points in our lead scoring system, and an Act-On sales rep is primed to reach out to her with some personalized information about our platform.\n\nAnd while we wish Tyson the small business owner well, his lead score is quite low — and our sales team will never waste a moment of anyone’s time trying to sell him advanced marketing tools he doesn’t need.\n\n(Keep Debbie and Tyson in mind. We’ll use them as examples again.)\n\n\nH3: Marketing Automation Migration: Key Steps & Mistakes to Avoid\n\n\nH3: Migrating your marketing automation platform doesn’t have to be difficult. Follow these important tips to get set up for migration success.\n\n\nH2: The benefits of lead scoring\n\nNow, let’s explore the host of benefits lead scoring delivers — for everyone involved.\n\n\nH3: A better experience for your leads\n\nJust like overeager blind dates, it’s a big turnoff for prospective customers when a brand comes on too strong or too fast.\n\nFor leads at the very beginning of their buyer’s journey, premature sales conversations are intrusive and unwelcome. Lead scoring helps give your prospects the time they need to get to know your brand. This creates a positive experience and builds trust over time, rather than rushing into a sales conversation with a skeptical prospect who has no understanding of what your brand stands for and the value you can deliver.\n\n\nH3: Less wasted time for your sales team\n\nQualifying leads takes time. Lead scoring helps your sales team spend their valuable hours more efficiently.\n\n“Having no lead scoring in place is really damaging to a sales team,” says our own Suzy Balk, Sr. Marketing Campaigns Manager. “A good sales rep is going to spend at least three minutes digging into every lead that comes in: what the company does, confirming an individual’s role, and understanding what pain points may exist that resonate with your solution. If your company has a lot of leads coming in, that multiplies out to a lot of time.”\n\n\nH3: Better follow-up on MQLs\n\nUsually, marketing’s biggest beef with their counterparts in sales is failing to follow up (or follow up fast enough) with their leads.\n\nNow, not to take sides, but if your sales team is swamped with unqualified leads…unsatisfactory follow-up is going to happen. Busy sales reps aren’t going to prioritize marketing-”qualified” leads if you’re actually sending them marketing-”questionable” leads.\n\nWith lead scoring, the sales team can have confidence that marketing is handing over leads who are relevant and ready for a conversation. A survey from Gartner reports that 64% of sales reps are more likely to follow up on marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) if the qualification criteria is agreed on in advance.\n\nWhich brings us to…\n\n\nH3: Improved sales and marketing alignment\n\nSales and marketing alignment isn’t easy to achieve. But lead scoring is a team sport.\n\nMarketing and sales leaders have to work together to agree on the overall framework and specific scoring criteria used to move a prospect along their buying journey. Getting these teams in the same room and on the same page about what makes a qualified lead helps improve communication, collaboration, and accountability.\n\n\nH3: Better nurturing for marketing\n\nLead scoring isn’t just about reaching a certain threshold and transitioning ownership from marketing to sales. It also helps marketing teams improve their lead nurturing programs by using lead scores as a layer of segmentation. (More on this below.)\n\n\nH3: Higher conversion rates for everyone\n\nAll these benefits add up to one clear outcome that everyone will celebrate: higher conversion rates for MQLs.\n\nWhen the sales team talks to a prospect who’s already visited multiple pages across your company’s website, engaged with emails, and interacted with content at different stages of the buyer’s journey, they’re talking to warm leads who are much more receptive to a conversation and closer to making a purchase.\n\nThat means a shorter, smoother journey along the sales cycle, a higher likelihood of that lead becoming an opportunity and – eventually – more closed deals.\n\nNow that we know why lead scoring is important and what it can deliver, let’s dive into the nitty-gritty: how to make it happen by building a lead scoring marketing framework .
